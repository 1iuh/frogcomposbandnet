Weaponmasters

The weaponmaster is great with a single class of weapons. The character 
gets combat bonuses and special powers depending on the type of 
specialization. Alas, the weaponmaster is truly lousy when using any 
weapon outside their chosen specialty so focus is key.

Axes
The mighty axe! Your blows will cleave with damage unsurpassed. 
Specializing in axes gives great offensive prowess, especially when 
your axe is wielded with two hands. However, this speciality offers 
little in the way of utility. Kill quickly as your life depends on it!

Bows
You will shoot to kill! The bowmaster gains techniques to enhance 
shooting, including more rapid firing, the ability to volley shots over 
the heads of intervening monsters, reduced ammo destruction, the 
ability to kill with a single arrow and much more. As a shooter, your 
missile prowess will be quite formidable, though your melee will be 
somewhat lacking.

Clubs
You will seek to club your opponents senseless! This speciality gains 
passive status effects against monsters, such as confusion, knock out 
and stunning. Also, you will gain some limited utility techniques. At 
high levels, your weapons will become more likely to score devastating, 
crushing blows against your hapless enemies.

Crossbows
The crossbowmaster shoots deadly bolts for great damage. Their bolts 
may explode powerfully damaging nearby monsters. Also, they may shoot 
so hard as to knock their opponents backwards!

Daggers
A knife in the back! This speciality favors dual wielding and 
rogue-like behavior. The daggermaster can even assume the posture of 
The Flying Dagger which greatly enhances their low level dagger toss 
capability. Indeed, their prowess with the dagger toss is legendary and 
appears almost magical! At high levels, you will also gain formidable 
melee prowess with the Frenzy Stance. Finally, daggermasters have very 
strong short ranged teleport techniques that synergize well with their 
toss abilities.

Shields
Specializing in shields gives excellent powers of defense and 
retaliation. In addition, you can even choose to melee with your shield 
rather than a normal weapon, bashing your opponents senseless. This 
form of combat is known as Shield Bashing and is unique to this 
speciality.

Slings
Watch out, Goliath! As a master of slings you will shoot pebbles with 
uncanny speed. Your shots may even ricochet off other monsters to score 
multiple hits. As with other archery specializations, your ammo will 
break less often and, at high levels you will gain access to an 
'unlimited quiver' which allows you to shoot an infinite amount of 
(average) ammo.

Diggers
A master of digging. You prefer rocky enclosures and don't mind lugging 
around a corpse or two, which you can bury in a pinch for a temporary 
bonus. You can choose one of several postures which allow you to use 
the digging bonus of your current weapon as an additional bonus, such 
as increased strength, constitution, or even speed! So keep your eye 
open for those +8 diggers!
