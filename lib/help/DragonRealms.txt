[[[[B|  Dragon Realms

  Dragons are magical creatures and may choose to learn a particular branch of
  dragon magic. Unlike normal spell casters, dragons do not need spell books to
  cast or learn powers. Instead, they simply gain spells as they mature. Each
  realm of dragon magic has a direct impact on the player's stats and skills,
  and each realm also requires a different stat for casting purposes.


***** <Lore>
[[[[r|  Lore

  Dragons specializing in lore are seekers of knowledge. They are the most
  intelligent of dragonkind and use their vast intellects to drive their magic.
  Armed with a vast array of detection and knowledge spells, dragons of lore
  seek power through knowledge. They eventually gain powers of telepathy and
  automatic object identification.


***** <Breath>
[[[[r|  Breath

  Dragon breath is the stuff of legends, and this realm seeks to enhance this
  most powerful attribute of dragonkind. With this speciality, you will be able
  to shape and control your breaths to maximize deadliness for a given
  situation. In addition, dragons of this realm may choose their breath types
  if applicable, and breathing becomes less costly as they mature. This focus
  requires great fortitude to master and somewhat dimishes the dragon's
  defenses and melee.


***** <Attack>
[[[[r|  Attack

  Attack dragons seek melee supremacy above all else. This realm offers
  powerful attack spells to support a race that is already among the melee
  elite, and the result can be truly awe-inspiring. With this realm, the dragon
  may rend their opponents with extra sharp claws, may reach out to bite
  distant foes, may snatch an adjacent opponent in their powerful jaws and then
  toss them about like a rag doll, and may even augment their bite attacks with
  their breath element! Truly, a rampaging dragon is an awe inspiring sight,
  one that is seldom witnessed (or perhaps seldom survived?). This focus values
  strength above all else.


***** <Craft>
[[[[r|  Craft

  The most powerful magical items have long been believed forged by
  dragonflame. The craft dragon gains powers of enchantment and may even
  reforge artifacts into the objects of their choosing!


***** <Armor>
[[[[r|  Armor



***** <Recovery>
[[[[r|  Recovery



***** <Domination>
[[[[r|  Domination



***** <Crusade>
[[[[r|  Crusade



***** <Death>
