<style:title>Skillmasters</style>

Using a point based skill system, the Skillmaster allows you to design your own class. Upon birth, you will receive 5 points to spend, and you will gain an additional skill point on ever 5 levels of experience (for a total of 15 skill points). You may Gain a skill with the G command (which is the same command spellcasters use to gain a spell).

To play the Skillmaster effectively, you should have a plan as to which skills you will learn and when. Since there are many more skills to learn than you could possibly hope to acquire with just 15 skill points, and since your skill choices are permanent, you will be stuck with the choices you make. So, unlike a spellcaster that can be assured of eventually learning all spells, you will not be able to play this class effectively without a bit of forethought. This document should help.

<topic:Overview><style:heading>Overview of the Various Skills</style>

The available skills come in various kinds, or groups. You learn individual skills, but the number of points in the corresponding group is sometimes also important. For example, the first group of skills is Melee. Here, you may choose skills to specialize in various classes of melee weapons, or even in bare handed combat (Martial Arts). The total number of points spent in the group determines your overall Melee skill (as shown on the Character Sheet) as well as your starting STR and DEX. On the other hand, the number of points spent in the skill itself determines your proficiency with that particular class of weaponry and also influences how many attacks per round you get. Each skill group is discussed in detail below.

The main skill groups are:

  <color:R>Melee</color>       <indent>Effectiveness in hand to hand combat</indent>

  <color:R>Ranged</color>      <indent>Effectiveness with ranged combat (e.g. Archery)</indent>

  <color:R>Magic</color>       <indent>Access to most spell realms as an INT based caster</indent>

  <color:R>Prayer</color>      <indent>Access to a few spell realms as a WIS based caster</indent>

  <color:R>Skills</color>      <indent>Improve basic skills such as Devices, Stealth, Speed and Saving Throw</indent>

  <color:R>Techniques</color>  <indent>Access to advanced or unusual talents that most players lack. This includes some book based talents, such as Burglary and Kendo, as well as other non-standard talents like Riding and Dual Wielding.</indent>

  <color:R>Abilities</color>   <indent>For a single skill point, you can buy a power like Stone Skin or an ability like Good Luck.</indent>

<topic:Proficiency><style:heading>Proficiency</style>

Before discussing each of the skill groups in detail, it is useful to make a note regarding the proficiency system. As you are aware, normal classes improve in various aspects of the game through practice. This applies to individual weapons and shooters as well as to individual spells. Initially, the player is unskilled with an item or spell, and must practice using it in order to acquire proficiency. Should they change weapons or switch to using a different spell, the process is repeated. In addition, there is also a proficiency system for various broad skills such as riding, dual wielding, and martial arts. If you have ever tried to master these broad skills, then you know it often takes most of the game to learn them.

But the Skillmaster is completely different. Indeed, they do not learn through use and practice. Rather, when they buy into a skill, they instantly acquire proficiency. As an example (of very bad advice), a first level Skillmaster could spend all 5 points in Dual Wielding (or in Riding) and instantly achieve Master level proficiency. Similarly with weapons. The number of points in a particular weapon class sets your proficiency level, and this level never improves ... unless you spend more skill points!

<topic:Melee><style:heading>Melee Skills</style>

Melee skills affect your skill in hand to hand combat. Each skill in this group affects a single class of weapons (swords, polearms, blunt weapons, diggers) or allows bare handed martial arts fighting. To use any particular class of weaponry, you will need some skill. Thus, when investing in melee skills, you must choose whether to specialize in one or two classes of weapons, or whether to spread out your skill. You will be less effective in the latter case, but you will have access to more kinds of weapons (and less frustration when finding awesomely powerful weapons that you cannot wield).

The total number of points in this group determines your basic melee skills in the same way that a normal class choice determines melee skills. That is, you get a fixed amount of base melee skill, and an extra amount that improves with level. Warriors are very good fighter. Mages, not so much. But you, as a Skillmaster, can improve your melee whenever you choose, simply by investing more points in various melee related skills. As a rough guide, consider the following tables:

  <color:R>Melee Group                          Weapon Class</color>
  <color:G>Pts  Relative Skill                  Pts  Proficiency Blows</color>
    0  Mage                              0  Unskilled   4.00
  1-2  Priest                            1  Beginner    5.00
  3-4  Ranger                            2  Skilled     5.25
  5-8  Paladin                           3  Expert      5.50
   9+  Warrior                           4  Master      5.75
                                         5  Master      6.00

Note that Melee and Magic are somewhat antithetical. Investing in Melee also improves your starting STR and DEX, but too many magic points will decrease your STR (and CON). Magic points also decrease the maximum number of blows displayed in the table above (currently, by just 0.05 blows per point, but too much magic will make this effect noticeable). Also, Magic improves INT and your device skill, but too much Melee will have a slight negative effect on both of these.

Each skill in the Melee group should be fairly obvious (except perhaps Martial Arts). Basically, when you wield a melee weapon, the game checks the number of skill points in the appropriate group to determine your proficiency and to calculate your number of attacks per round. The individual melee skills are discussed next.

  <indent><topic:Swords><color:o>Swords</color>

Swords are the most common class of weaponry and includes the basic Long Sword, Broad Sword, Bastard Sword, and Two-Handed Sword, as well as all the shorter daggers and such. If you look at the proficiency screen (~P) then swords are all those weapons displayed in the first column. If you are specializing in a particular class of weaponry, then swords and polearms are both good choices. While their are many good blunt weapons, they are not nearly so common as swords and polearms are.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Polearms><color:o>Polearms</color>

Polearms are the next most common class of weaponry and includes the Trident, Spear, Lance, and Pike as well as all the Axes. If you look at the proficiency screen (~P), then all the polearms are listed in the second colum. Like swords, if you are specializing, then this is a good class to choose. In addition, if you are building a Riding class, then you really want to choose this skill as well to enable access to the various Lances. In fact, for riding based melee, the Heavy Lance is <color:v>the</color> weapon of choice!</indent>

  <indent><topic:Hafted><color:o>Hafted (Blunt Weapons)</color>

Hafted weapons are currently about half as common as either swords or polearms. The traditional province of the priest, blunt weapons include the Mace, Whip, Club, and War Hammer, as well as various Staves. The most deadly weapon in the game, the Mace of Disruption, is also in this group (see the third column on the proficiency screen for a complete list). But note that unlike the Priest, a Prayer based Skillmaster has <color:v>no</color> weapon restrictions. Still, this group is worth investing in if you want access to general weapon based melee. For example, with 6 total points in melee, investing 2 in each of Swords, Polearms and Hafted is a reasonable balanced approach (Personally, I have trouble resisting 5 in a single class, but that is my own problem and need not be yours as well :).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Diggers><color:o>Diggers</color>

Yes, you can melee with Picks and Shovels if you want, but the weapons in this class are incredibly uncommon when compared to the three main groups. Still, there are a couple of powerful end game diggers, and this class of weaponry might be worth a point or two should you find one.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Martial Arts><color:o>Martial Arts</color>

With this skill you may fight monsters using a special, bare-handed combat technique. I assume you've played a Monk before (if not, try one as they are most enjoyable) and this skill allows you access to this powerful mode of combat. If you are building a Martial Artist, then I recommend using the full 5 points for this skill as that will give you 100% monk-like efficiency when choosing types of attacks and critical hits. But, unlike the monk, you will get one fewer attack per round.

A few cautions regarding this skill are in order. First, if you fight bare-handed, then you get the normal monk armor restrictions as well as the AC bonus when forgoing various equipment slots (but you do not gain a monk speed boost or access to various postures). These armor restrictions do not apply if you switch to normal weapon based melee. Second, martial arts will not work when mounted so it is a bad idea to waste your precious skill points on Riding when building a martial arts based class. Finally, you've played a Samurai before, right? Well, even if you have, you might never have noticed that casting a Kendo technique <color:v>requires a melee weapon</color>, so won't work at all with martial arts.

If you are looking for other skills to enhance martial arts, consider Stealth, Craft and Burglary.</indent>

<topic:Ranged><style:heading>Ranged Skills</style>

Ranged skills include Archery and Throwing. As a group, the total number of points affects your Ranged skill, as displayed on the Character Sheet. However, with only 2 skills in this group, it is usual that you should treat Archery and Throwing as mutually exclusive talents.

  <indent><topic:Archery><color:o>Archery</color>

With this skill, you gain proficiency with Slings, Bows and Crossbows. Each point grants enhanced proficiency with all missile weapons (contrast this with Melee skills which require you to specialize). With 2 or more points of Archery, you will begin to gain extra shots per round as well as reduced breakage odds for your missiles. You will never be so good as an Archer though with a full 5 points of Archery you can shoot just as well as a Ranger (and use Slings and Crossbows too, which a Ranger cannot). This skill also increases your stealth.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Throwing><color:o>Throwing</color>

With this skill, you will gain the power of <color:keyword>Throw Weapon</color> which allows you to effectively throw your leading melee weapon. The range of this talent depends exclusively on your STR and the weight of the weapon. The damage, however, depends on both the weapon (and any slays it might have) as well as on your STR and the amount of Throwing skill you have. In addition, with enough throwing skill, you may use this talent more quickly, allowing you to throw your weapon more than once per round.

Weapon throwing is not like Archery. For one thing, your weapon will often return to you after striking a foe. With more skill, this return effect can become (almost) certain. Also, you may catch the weapon upon return with the same hand which threw it, effectively re-equipping the weapon in a single, graceful, fluid motion. With more skill, catching the return weapon becomes more likely, though this depends on DEX as well. With a high enough DEX and a full amount of Throwing skill, you can be (almost) certain to recover your weapon, fully equipped, after each toss. However, you should always be prepared for an occasional failure, no matter how skilled you are (i.e., carry a spare weapon!).

The damage of your thrown weapon can be formidable. As your skill improves, so does the damage multiplier of the toss. You can think of each toss functioning as a single melee strike in terms of damage. In this analogy, increasing your skill increases the multiplier and functions just like multiple blows per round. However, there is only a single chance to hit on each toss, which can be frustrating if you hit a run of bad luck. Also, rings of combat, rings of archery, or gloves of slaying have no impact on throwing (either on accuracy or on damage). Once the weapon leaves your hand, magical equipment no longer has any influence. This is a bit sad, but, on the other hand, you can change your equipment preferences with this knowledge in mind, perhaps assuming a more defensive posture than you otherwise would.</indent>

<topic:Magic><style:heading>Magic Skills</style>

Each skill in the Magic group grants access to a single realm of book based spellcasting. This realm will use INT as your spellcasting stat for purposes of fail rates. Usually, you will also use INT as your mana stat, but this can be complicated if you learn Prayer skills or other magical Techniques. With INT based mana comes normal magelike glove encumbrance as well as the ability to benefit from wizardstaves and certain magical jewelry (This requires 5 points overall in the magic group).

With just a single point in a given realm, you will be a poor caster. In general, the more points you invest in a given realm, the better a caster you will become. You will gain access to more spells, and be able to cast them at a lower level of experience. The casting costs and fail rates will both diminish with each point of skill. Also, your minimum fail rate will go down (And you know how annoying 5% fail rates can be, don't you?). As a rule of thumb, you will need a full 5 points in a given realm to cast (almost) as well as a Mage would.

But, aside from this, their are no restrictions on which realms you may learn, and you can learn as many different realms as you like. You don't learn individual spells the way a mage might but can cast any spell in a known realm provided you have the book and your level is high enough. Finally, you need not worry about spell proficiency. As discussed above, the proficiency system does not apply to the Skillmaster.

See <link:magic.txt#MagicRealms> for the various magic realms. One final comment: The Life realm is not available as a Magic skill. Instead, to gain access to Life you must learn it as a Prayer skill.

The total number of points in this group determines your class skill with devices. However, for mage-like device skill, you will also need to invest in Skills/Devices. Your starting INT is also directly influenced by the total number of points in this group. Unfortunately, Magic impedes Melee skill, and too much magic will adversely affect your starting STR and CON.

<topic:Prayer><style:heading>Prayer Skills</style>

Prayer skills are like Magic skills in that each one grants access to a single realm of spellcasting. However, there are many differences. For one thing, each Prayer realm uses WIS as the spellcasting stat. As an overall Prayer caster, you will also use WIS as your mana stat and won't be subject to mage-like glove encumbrance. You can use wizardstaves with just 5 overall points in this group (provided it is your primary spellcasting group).

Another difference is that selection of realms in this group is extremeley limited, consisting of just those realms that are either good (Life and Crusade) or evil (Death and Daemon). Life magic is uniquely available as a Prayer skill. For the other realms, they can also be learned as Magic skills. However, the game will not allow you to learn a single realm as both a Prayer and as Magic, so you need to pick whether to use INT or WIS for these 3 realms.

The total number of points in this group determines your class saving throw skill as shown on the Character Sheet. You can also improve your saving throw by directly investing in <color:keyword>Skills/Magic Resistance</color>. Your total Prayer points also determines your starting WIS.

A final contrast between Magic and Prayer is that points in this group do not decrease your STR and CON the way Magic does. They do not diminish your maximum number of melee attacks either. However, Prayer has no influence on device skills, so you might need to directly invest in <color:keyword>Skills/Devices</color> when a Magic caster would not.

As mentioned above, a Prayer caster is not a priest. There are no weapon restrictions on this class so you can gleefully slice and dice while piously enjoying Life prayers. You can also freely mix good and evil realms like Life and Death, whereas a priest may not.
