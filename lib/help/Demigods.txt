<style:title>Demigod Parentage</style>

<color:heading>Minor-God</color>

Fathered by a minor god, you gain no starting powers.

<color:heading>Zeus</color>

Zeus, King of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus, is god of the Sky and Thunder, and nominal husband of Hera. You inherit increased stature and your divine birth will be marked by your aura of electricity. You also resist lightning.

<color:heading>Poseidon</color>

Poseidon, Brother of Zeus, is Lord of the Seas and Storm. You inherit elemental protection and corrosive attacks that melt the armor of your foes.

<color:heading>Hades</color>

Hades is Ruler of the Underworld. You gain resistance to nether forces, increased fortitude and have a firm grasp on your life and health.

<color:heading>Athena</color>

Athena is the great goddess of wisdom and the protector of Athens. She was born of Zeus and the Titan Metis, and her cunning far surpasses that of the other deities. You inherit great clarity of thought and magic and will be able to cast spells more reliably than other mortals. And should you fail to cast a spell, you will pay a reduced casting cost rather than the full amount. You have a firm grip on your mental prowess.

<color:heading>Ares</color>

Ares is the bold son of Zeus and Hera, whose very name is feared and respected by warriors and citizens alike. His legendary combat prowess exceeds that of Zeus and Poseidon, but he is less skilled in wiles than the other Olympians. You inherit exceptional bonuses to combat and have a firm grip on your strength. Later in life, you will be able to fly into a berserk rage on command. However, your lust for combat decreases your stealth as you call out challenges to all that you meet. And your resistance to magic is suspect.

<color:heading>Hermes</color>

Hermes, the Messenger, is the extremely cunning diplomat used by the Olympians to negotiate truces. With his Winged Sandals and his powerful magic, there is no place barred from him, and there is no way to detain him. You inherit great powers of motion and will never become slowed. Your stealth is better than your brethren and your speed will increase with experience.

<color:heading>Apollo</color>

Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and prophecy, medicine, healing, plague, music, poetry, arts, archery, and more. You inherit powers of illumination and are completely immune to light based attacks. You are seldom blinded.

<color:heading>Artemis</color>

Artemis was often described as the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows. You inherit powers of archery and are very nimble. Your skills with the bow are unmatched and you shoot arrows with increased range and deadliness.

<color:heading>Hephaestus</color>

Hephaestus was the god of technology, blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metals, metallurgy, fire and volcanoes. Like other mythic smiths but unlike most other gods, Hephaestus was lame, which gave him a grotesque appearance in Greek eyes. He served as the blacksmith of the gods. You inherit powers of enchantment and protection. Your equipment will not suffer diminution by corrosion or magical attack.

<color:heading>Hera</color>

Hera was the wife and one of three sisters of Zeus. Her chief function was as the goddess of women and marriage. You inherit great clarity of mind and capacity for magic. You are very wise and have a firm grasp on your magical energy, which is even augmented.

<color:heading>Demeter</color>

Demeter is the goddess of the harvest, who presided over grains, the fertility of the earth, and the seasons. You gain powers of regeneration, healing, and temperance. Eventually, you will become resistant to the ravages of time.

<color:heading>Aphrodite</color>

Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. You inherit her sex appeal. As such, your pets are more obedient and shopkeepers fawn over you in their efforts to please you. You may kiss monsters and they might even decide to follow you with slavish devotion, though sometimes this just angers them.
