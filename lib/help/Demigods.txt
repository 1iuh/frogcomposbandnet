<topic:Athena><color:o>Athena</color>
Athena is the great goddess of wisdom and the protector of Athens. She was born of Zeus and the Titan Metis, and her cunning far surpasses that of the other deities. You inherit great clarity of thought and magic and will be able to cast spells more reliably than other mortals. And should you fail to cast a spell, you will pay a reduced casting cost rather than the full amount. You also have a firm grip on your mental prowess.

<topic:Ares><color:o>Ares</color>
Ares is the bold son of Zeus and Hera, whose very name is feared and respected by warriors and citizens alike. His legendary combat prowess exceeds that of Zeus and Poseidon, but he is less skilled in wiles than the other Olympians. You inherit exceptional bonuses to combat and have a firm grip on your strength. Later in life, you will be able to fly into a berserk rage on command. However, your lust for combat decreases your stealth as you call out challenges to all that you meet. And your resistance to magic is suspect as well.

<topic:Aphrodite><color:o>Aphrodite</color>
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. You inherit her sex appeal. As such, your pets are more obedient and shopkeepers fawn over you in their efforts to please you. You may kiss monsters and they might even decide to follow you with slavish devotion, though sometimes this just angers them.
