<style:heading>The Newbie Guide<style:normal>

Welcome to PosChengband! This guide will attempt to give you a quick overview of the game and get you started on your path to slay the dreaded Serpent of Chaos.

<topic:Overview><style:heading>Overview<style:normal>

PosChengband is a single player role playing game where you, the brave adventurer, attempt to save the world by defeating evil monsters including, eventually, the Serpent of Chaos. The road is long, and the path is treacherous. Many have tried and failed, and the dungeons are littered with the bones of would be heroes. Do you have what it takes to succeed where so many others have failed? If so, read on.

<topic:CreatingACharacter><style:heading>Creating a Character<style:normal>

  Your first step will be to create your character. Since you are new to the
  game, I suggest you choose 'Beginner' at the initial prompt. This will greatly
  limit the complexity of the character creation process and also remove the
  wilderness option. After playing a few characters to get an idea of how to
  play, you can start a new character in 'Normal' mode to view all the options
  as well as enable the wilderness. Hey, it's not like your first character is
  going to win anyway!

  After choosing 'Beginner' mode, the game is going to walk you through creating
  your character. You can refer to [a] for more detailed info, but the basics
  are that you will choose a sex, a race and a class and then roll for stats.
  While your sex is not important (to the game), your race and class are key to
  everything that follows. Normally, the game has a vast (overwhelming?) array
  of choices that offer myriad, diverse playstyles, and it can take a while to
  even learn what is available. For now, we'll consider a few basic playstyles
  in order to get you going.

  The easiest style is 'Hack and Slash' and it is the essence of the warrior.
  Almost any race will make a good one, but you might consider trying a High-Elf
  or a Hobbit. Both are stealthy and have good magic skills that will assist the
  warriors weak points. But if you really want to turn on the melee power,
  nothing beats a Half-Troll. Be warned: Trolls are ugly and stupid, not to
  mention widely hated. Shopkeepers are loath to sell to one as ugly as you
  so you'll have a harder time shopping. You can compensate by going on a
  killing rampage, which is more fun anyway. As a warrior, there isn't much
  strategy: simply find monsters and kill them! Look for better armor and
  weapons. Perhaps you can shoot a crossbow for a little bit of distance damage
  but your mainstay will be hand to hand combat. For stats, you'll want  to
  start with 17 in both Strength and Dexterity and can ignore everything else.

  Another style is to take the stealthy approach and play a rogue. Again,
  Hobbits and High-Elves are good for beginners. You'll want good fighting
  stats (Strength and Dexterity) as before, but this time, you also have
  the ability to cast magic spells. And while magic is not your forte, it
  eventually becomes very useful, so you'll want a decent Intelligence as
  well. (Every spellcaster has a primary stat for purposes of casting spells,
  and you can find this information out by reading the various class desc-
  riptions during the birth process, or by refering to the help files). Now
  you can't just roll 17 for every stat you need, so you'll need to be less
  greedy. I'd go with 16 for each, or perhaps 17 for Str and Dex and 14 for
  Int. Play around to see what you can get from the auto-roller. Also, once
  you pick your class, you'll need to pick a spell realm as well. Try Sorcery
  or, better yet, Burglary. Both have good detection but Burglary is uniquely
  designed for rogues allowing the player to do things like set traps and
  pick pockets. Fun stuff!

  Finally, you can play with Magic as your forte as a mage. Gnomes and High-
  Elves are excellent choices here (Some would say that High-Elves are a
  munchkin race!). But magic takes some time to get good with, so I don't
  recommend this right away unless you are a patient person. Pick Chaos and
  then Sorcery for your spell realms and then roll a 17 Intelligence and
  a high Strength as well (say 15 or more). You'll need the Strength to carry
  goodies that you find in the dungeon. The Chaos realm gives good offense
  while Sorcery complements that with utility.

  We'll discuss these three styles more as we proceed through this guide.

***** <EquippingForDanger>
  [[[[r|Equipping for Danger

  Once you have completed the birth process, you will find yourself in the
  town on the surface. Since you picked 'Beginner', there will be no wilderness
  to explore. In this case, the only reason to return to the surface is to buy
  and sell equipment in the town. When you start, you have some initial gear
  that varies with your class, and it should already be equipped for your. You
  also have a small amount of gold which you can use to augment your supplies
  for that first trip into danger.

  So, what do you see at first?

  Well, that @ in the center of the screen is you for starters. Also, those
  '#' characters are walls and you can see they are shaped into buildings
  for the various shops. Each building has a number or '+' character that you
  may enter by moving onto that square. Each number stands for a different type
  of shop. You can move about with the arrow keys and look about with the 'l'
  command followed by the arrow keys. That 'f' is a monster and you should look
  at it with the 'l' command to see if it seems threatening:

[[[[w|The Scrawny cat ('|[[[[U|f|[[[[w|')/('|[[[[U|f|[[[[w|'):  [r,q,t,p,o,+,-,<dir>]
[[[[w|No battles to the death are recalled.
[[[[w|A skinny little furball with sharp claws and a menacing look.
[[[[w|It lives in the town, and moves a bit erratically at normal speed.  Nothing is
[[[[w|known about its attack.

  Hmmm, probably no need to worry about Ms. Kitty.

  If you are playing a mage, your first order of business is to learn a new
  spell ('G' to Gain a spell). At first level, you can only learn one, so make
  it count. I recommend learning Magic Missile first, assuming you followed my
  advice and chose the Chaos realm. As a mage, you really need to use magic to
  kill stuff so your first spell has to be something offensive. Later on, when
  you are more experienced, you may pick Detect Monsters from the Sorcery realm.
  To cast a spell, use the magic command ('m') and follow the instructions. Not
  every class can learn a spell right away, however. A rogue, for example,
  must reach level 5 (CL5) in order to learn their first spell.

  Next, you should shop for gear. I recommend buying some means of escape, such
  as scrolls of teleport or phase door from the Alchemy Shop ('5'). Also, you
  will want some means of healing from the Temple ('4'). If you are playing a
  rogue, try to buy a sling and some ammo (pebbles or shots) from the Weapon
  Smiths ('3'). When you enter a store, you will see a list of inventory as
  well as a list of commands to use. Simply follow the instructions to make a
  purchase.

  Sorry about that, Ms. Kitty! You can see her scrawny corpse (~) as well as my
  deadly shot ([[[[s|{|) lying on the ground. Sometimes your missile ammo will
  break on impact, but if it doesn't you'll want to go gather it up after you
  are done fighting. You can pickup objects by moving on top of them and using
  the get command ('g').

  If you have money left over, go to the General Store ('1') and buy a lantern
  and some oil. Lanterns cast more light than torches and allow you to see
  further in the dark. Sell your starting torches. Oh, and be sure to equip
  your lantern to actually use it ('w' to wear an item).

  Of course, it's possible that these items will not be available in the stores.
  The stores will "refresh" themselves every so often, getting rid of old items
  and buying new ones. If you ever find that there's something you need which
  the stores don't currently have, you can come back a bit later. However, to
  prevent "town scumming," the stores won't actually restock unless you do a bit
  of adventuring first.

  Hopefully, you managed all of this without too much trouble from the locals
  ('t'), but occasionally the townsfolk will interact with you. This may be
  simply annoying, as there are plenty of drunks about, but it can also be
  dangerous as urchins have been known to steal gold and you look like an easy
  mark. You can attack a monster by simply moving into it, assuming you have a
  weapon equipped. If you are playing a mage, you should learn your Magic
  Missile spell first ('G' allows you to Gain a spell) and fight with that
  instead ('m' allows you to cast a magic spell).

***** <MyFirstTripDown>
  [[[[r|My First Trip Down

  Since this is the 'Beginner' mode, there is only one dungeon to enter. The
  '>' character represents the stairs down while the '<' character represents
  the stairs up. Coincidentally, these are also the keys you press to go down
  and up, respectively. So move to the stairs down to Angband and enter the
  dungeon!

  You might see something like this. As you walk about, beware of monsters and
  use the look command ('l') together with the recall option ('r') to get a
  verbose monster description. (I think I can step on that ant!):

[[[[w|The Soldier ant ('|[[[[u|a|[[[[w|')/('|[[[[u|a|[[[[w|'):  [r,q,t,p,o,+,-,<dir>]
[[[[w|No battles to the death are recalled.

  If you compare the monster description with the initial one, you will notice
  that things have updated. For one thing, the game tracks the number of times
  that you have killed a given monster (or that it has killed you!). Also, we
  have learned some information about this monster, such as its native depth
  on level 1 (DL1) as well as the fact that it is a [[[[G|natural| creature.
  Some magical weapons can slay animals, and would do more damage than normal
  against them. Finally, you can see that I gain 2 experience points for killing
  one. Gain enough experience and you may reach level 2! Characters can get as
  high as CL50 in this game, so we have a long way to go. And monsters can get
  as difficult as DL100 so we really shouldn't feel too proud of ourselves so
  early on.

  At this point, you basically explore the current level. You can walk back to
  town at any time by going back up those stairs you just descended. You can
  also find new stairs down to deeper depths. Basically, the deeper you go, the
  more difficult things become, so you'll want to take it easy on the stairs at
  first.

  So, walk around a bit and kill stuff. Don't worry too much about dying as it
  will probably happen quite a bit at first. And if it does, the next time you
  load this savefile the birth process will give you an extra option to 'Quick
  Start' this character, which basically skips the entire birth process and
  rolls and character identical with the last. So it's easy to start up again
  after you die.

  Oops, I think I'm in trouble:

  But never fear, I can quickly start over. Notice the new birth option:

[[[[w|  Do you want to use the quick start function(same character as your last one).
[[[[w|
[[[[w|
[[[[w|          Use quick start? [y/N]

  Choosing 'y' immediately recreates a new character with the same race, class
  and stats as the old one and immediately places me back in town:

  are gone, and I have no experience. However, my monster memory survives, so

  Go ahead an play a bit. At this point, the tutorial is over and I'll just
  give some basic tidbits about the game.

  Every monster uses a unique ASCII character that sort of tells you what it is.
  For example, rats use the letter 'r' while orcs use the letter 'o'. When you
  see a character you don't understand, press 'l' to look at it. If it is a
  monster, you can then press 'r' to recall information about it, including a
  description that will give you more information.  Other characters like '/'
  and '!' represent objects that you may pick up ('g' to get) and then use.

  How you use an object will depend upon its type. Some common examples are:

  Char  Object         Usage
  ====  ============== =========================================================
  ,     Food           'E' to eat it. Do this whenever you feel hungry.
  !     Potion         'q' to quaff it. Try to identify the potion first.
  ?     Scroll         'r' to read it.
  ?     Spellbook      'r' to read it. 'G' to gain a spell. 'm' to cast.
  -     Wand           'a' to aim it.
  -     Rod            'z' to zap it.
  _     Staff          'u' to use it.
  ~     Lantern        'w' to wear it. 'F' to refill it with oil.
  /     Polearm        'w' to wield it.
  \     Hafted Weapon  'w' to wield it.
  |     Sword          'w' to wield it.
  (     Soft Armor     'w' to wear it.
  [     Hard Armor     'w' to wear it.
  ]     Misc. Armor    'w' to wear it.

  If you want to know what a specific symbol stands for, type "/", and then the
  symbol. For instance, if you're wondering what all the t's are, type "/t", and
  the game will tell you that these are townspeople. You can also "l"ook at an
  item, feature, or monster. While looking, pressing space or enter will cycle
  through the different "interesting" things in view. There is also a full map
  function: type "M". It will bring up a map of the entire area. Finally, if you
  type "L", you can scroll the (full-zoom) map around the dungeon. In general,
  you can use "M" to find areas that look interesting and "L" to look at them
  in detail.

  From here on we'll be giving detailed dungeon survival information. Some of it
  is intuitive, and some of it you aren't likely to find out without a lot of
  deaths first. If you want to experience the painful learning process in all
  it's glory, don't read further. If, however, you're sick and tired of dying,
  read ahead.

  [[[[r|On Weapons and Multiple Blows

  Some characters will start the game being able to get multiple blows per
  round with their weapon when attacking.  Whether or not you get more
  blows than this later in the game will be determined by your class,
  your weapon weight, your Strength, and your Dexterity. Check your
  Character display (type "C"):

  ['c'hange name, 'f'ile, 'n'ext, [[[[y|'w'eapons, 'b'ows|, ESC to quit]

  See where it says 'w' for Weapons? Choose that option and you will be shown
  some very detailed combat information for your character:

  Hand #1: a Dagger (1d4) (+0,+0)                            Accuracy
  Weight : 1.2 lbs                                            AC Hit
  To Hit : 0 + 5 = 5                                          25 75%
  To Dam : 0 + 2 = 2                                          50 55%
  Blows  : 2.52                                               75 34%
  Damage                                                     100 13%
  Crits  : 1.00x (0.7%)                                      125  5%
  Normal : 11 (7-15) [1.00x]                                 150  5%
                                                             175  5%
                                                             200  5%

  In my case, this is a newborn adventurer still using his starting dagger.
  But you'll notice that he is getting multiple blows per round, 2.52 in this
  case. What could that possibly mean? Actually, it's rather simple: 52% of
  the time I will get 3 attacks per round while 48% of the time, only 2. How
  is that number determined and what can I do to make it bigger? Good
  questions! The melee calculation is a little complicated, but basically it
  depends on the weapon and how heavy it is, your stats and how strong and
  dextrous you are, and your class. Rogues often get extra blows quicker,
  especially with lighter weapons. This is because their class favors light
  weapons such as daggers, and the game encourages this. Most other characters
  won't start with so many attacks. And you'll notice that while I get 2.52
  attacks per round, my damage is rather pathetic (11 damage per round).

  The Weapon Info screen also displays melee accuracy. Of course, you won't
  hit every time you swing. Accuracy depends on you skill with the weapon as
  well as its magical bonuses, if any. It also depends on your fighting skill
  (Shown on the initial Character Sheet above under the Skills section for
  Melee. My Melee skill is 'Excellent' in this case) which increases with
  stats (Strength and Dexterity) as well as experience (Level). All of this
  competes against the monster's armor class (AC). Basically, some monsters
  are harder to hit than others. Dragons are notoriously tough skinned, for
  example.

  You may also get detailed information on your missile weapon by pressing 'b'
  from the Character Screen:

 Shooting: a Sling (x2) (+0,+0)
 Range   : 160'
 Shots   : 1.30

 To Hit  : 0 + 5 = 5

 Weight  : 0.5 lbs                                                 50 62%
 To Hit  : 0 + 5 = 5                                              100 28%

  In this case, you see I get multiple shots, but ranged combat works a bit
  differently than melee combat. Rather than taking all of your allowed shots
  in a single round, you take one at a time, but the game charges you less than
  the full amount of energy per shot. I haven't explained the speed system yet,
  but suffice it to say that less energy per action means you move faster, and
  can do more before any nearby monsters get a chance to act.

  These two screens, Weapon Info and Shooter Info, will become more and more
  useful to you as you play the game. Don't worry if you don't understand every-
  thing displayed on them at the moment.

***** <OnArmorAndResistance>
  [[[[r|On Armor and Resistance

  We just saw how monsters have this attribute called armor class, and how this
  makes them harder to hit. Similarly, the player has an armor class which is
  determined by the armor they are currently wearing as well as their dexterity.
  In addition to making you harder to hit, AC also actually reduces the damage
  from certain types of melee attacks, so it is a very important attribute
  that you will want to increase as much as possible. If every you find yourself
  getting destroyed in melee, you'll want to look for better AC from your gear.

  Here is my Character Screen where you can see my starting AC:

  In addition to AC, though, the player has a very important set of resistances.
  Or, in this case, rather a lack of resistances. See the Next option ('n') on
  the Character Screen? Choose that (successively) and you get to see, in all
  its gritty detail, how woefully inadequate your starting character actually
  is. Here is my first resistance screen:

              | }   ~(                                  | }   ~(

  The first column is for resistances and the second for miscellaneous
  abilities. So what is resistance and why should you care? Basically, monster
  attacks often have an elemental flavor to them. Their damage has a 'type'.
  For example, a fire breathing dragon breathes ... well, fire! And your fire
  resistance helps you withstand that particular type of damage. Many damage
  types also have effects as well. Sticking with our fiery example, this type
  of attack can destroy items in your pack, especially scrolls and spellbooks.
  Your fire resistance helps out here as well. Here is a short summary of
  attack types as well as when you'd like to have resistance. Be warned that
  some monster attacks can be very deadly, killing you in a single attack if
  you are unprepared!

  Type       Comment
  ====       =============================================================
  Acid       Destroys scrolls/staves. Damages armor. DL30.
  Elec       Destroys rings/wands and reduces Dex. DL30.
  Fire       Destroys scrolls/staves/spellbooks. DL20.
  Cold       Destroys potions. DL30.
  Poison     Known to instantly kill many an adventurer. DL40
  Nexus      Scrambles stats and teleports player. Not very damaging.
  Confusion  Confuses you so you can't act. DL30.
  Paralysis  Freezes the player so you lose turns. Get Free Action by DL30.

  My character is not completely hopeless. Being a High-Elf, I begin with Light
  Resistance (30%) and See Invisible. The latter allows me to see ghosts and
  other invisible monsters. Without it, I wouldn't be able to see it when
  certain monsters attack me, which can be very annoying, not to mention deadly.
  See Invisible (like Free Action) is one of the required abilities that you
  will want as soon as possible.

  And while your race can grant resistances and abilities, most of the time
  these come from your gear. The 'abcd...' list across the top of each column
  corresponds to my current equipment set, and the corresponding item character
  is displayed if an item is actually equipped in that slot (e.g. | for my
  dagger, which is categorized by the game as a sword). So you can track your
  current resistances and abilities here as well as see where you are getting a
  given attribute. The '@' character corresponds to the player (displayed as
  an @, remember?) and lists innate racial abilities, as well as temporarily
  acquired magical enhancements (There might be a potion that grants temporary
  resistance, for example).

  In general, you will want to cover as many resistances as possible.
  They are not so important early in the game, but as you descend deeper, you
  will learn what you need and when. Abilities are often optional, except for
  Free Action and See Invisible which you will want by DL20 if possible. Hold
  Life starts to become desirable around DL35 or so. You can play without it,
  but it's just to darn annoying!

  Also note that resistances stack. If two items grant fire resistance, your
  percentage resistance goes up (but not linearly). Multiple sources of a given
  resistance also help to prevent many of the nasty side effects for various
  damage types.

***** <OnMagicalItems>
  [[[[r|On Important Magical Items

  Magical Items are an important part of every players repertoire, even the
  warrior's. There are seveal types of magic that every player needs.

  [[[[B|Teleporation and Escape

  It is very easy to become surrounded, or cut off from a safe retreat. Even
  the mightiest of warriors can become overwhelmed by sheer numbers. And this
  doesn't even account for the fact that many monsters can summon other monsters
  who can themselves summon other monster summoning monsters. Things can go
  bad in a heart beat, and when it does, you'll want to have a magical means
  of escape at the ready.

  [[[[r|Phase Door|
  This is a short range teleport that usually won't get you out of danger. It
  is useful for distance damage tactics such as the Shoot 'n Scoot maneuver
  discussed below.

  [[[[r|Teleport|
  A longer range escape that is the mainstay of most retreats. However, this
  escape is a bit risky as you may land in a worse situation than you started
  in.

  [[[[r|Teleport Away|
  This teleports all monsters in a line away, but many monsters resist and
  some are immune. It is generally useful for getting rid of a single trouble-
  some opponent while preserving your current position. It is also essential
  for attempting to clear treasure vaults.

  [[[[r|Teleport Level|
  This is the safest escape, moving you up or down an entire dungeon level.
  You abandon the current level and all of its goodies, although sometimes
  you can find your way back through the new level's staircases.

  [[[[r|Destruction|
  This powerful spell removes everything (including artifacts!) from the area
  around you, blasting the surroundings and causing rock to fall from the
  ceiling. If you're ever in deep trouble, this is a good way to escape.
  However, even Destruction isn't foolproof: monsters get a saving throw and
  can avoid being removed. I recommend saving scrolls of destruction for the
  final battle. You will need plenty to deal with all of the Serpent's summons.

  [[[[B|Healing and Recovery
  During your adventures, things will hurt you. This cannot be avoided.
  Fortunately, there are many magical potions that cure your wounds as well
  as various status ailments like blindness, confusion and poison.

  [[[[r|Cure Light Wounds|
  Restores a small amount of hitpoints, perhaps 10 or so. And while it won't
  completely cure cuts, it does reduce their effects (Cuts cause you to bleed
  out, losing hitpoints every few turns). It also cures blindness which is
  important since you need to be able to see in order to read a scroll or
  cast a spell from your spellbook (Not to mention see who is attacking you!).

  [[[[r|Cure Serious Wounds|
  Restores a bit more hp, perhaps 20 or so. It also cures blindness and
  confusion and reduces your cut status.

  [[[[r|Cure Critical Wounds|
  Even better! It heals about 30 hp and cures most ailments: blindness,
  confusion, cuts and stuns are completely cured. So is poison.

  The above three are readily available in the town at the Temple, and you
  should stock up on them as much as possible. The following must be found
  in the dungeon or purchased in the Black Market:

  [[[[r|Curing|
  Like Cure Critical Wounds, only better. It heals around 50hp and cures every
  status ailment excluding Fear. Even Hallucination is cured which is often
  very welcome as the mere sight of certain monsters is enough to trigger this
  crippling effect.

  [[[[r|Healing|
  Big time hp recovery at about 300hp. Also, most status ailments are cured
  except for fear and hallucination.

  [[[[r|*Healing*|
  Bigger time hp recovery at about 1000hp. Also, most status ailments are cured
  except for fear and hallucination. These potions are very rare and should be
  saved for the final two battles.

  [[[[r|Life|
  Restores your stats, all your hp and removes all status ailments except Fear.
  These potions are so rare, they should be saved for the final battle.

  [[[[B|Knowledge

  When you find a new object, you generally won't know anything about it. In
  order to learn about the objects you find, you need some means of knowledge.
  Every player has an innate sense about some of the objects they find and
  simply carrying the object around in your pack for a while can give you a
  clue as to its worth. This ability is called pseudo-id and is discussed
  elsewhere in the documentation. In general, it only works on equipment such
  as weapons and armor, although certain classes like Mages can sense the worth
  of rings and amulets. I mention pseudo-id since it is your most important
  means of knowledge in the early game. You can also learn what some objects
  are by trying them out. For example, you can eat a newly found mushroom, or
  quaff that new potion in your pack. However, if you try this, you'll quickly
  learn it is a bad idea for mushrooms and potions. For magical devices like
  wands, rods and staves, it is acceptable to try them as you find them. But
  once you have Identify, you'll want to use that instead.

  Later on, you'll want to improve your means of knowledge and there are two
  steps in this process (after pseudo-id). The first is called Identify and the
  second is called *Identify*. The first gives cursory knowledge of an object,
  revealing its full name and magical combat bonuses or AC bonuses. For potions
  and scrolls it reveals the name of the object which is often enough for you
  to tell whether or not it is useful (And once you learn a given flavor of
  potion, scroll or mushroom, you will automatically recognize the next one
  you find. So identifying 'flavors' is important in the early game. By the
  way, you can also sell an object to *Identify* it, but then you won't have
  it anymore! Still, it's something to consider for the early game when most
  stuff is junk anyway). The second means of enhanced knowledge, *Identify*,
  gives complete information about the object, including all of its powers and
  resistances, many of which won't be learned by simply Identifying the object.
  Both Identify and *Identify* are available in scroll and device form. Both
  are also available as a town service (for a cost). In general, you'll want
  to carry lots of Identify to weed out the junk while exploring the dungeon.
  Once you return to town, you can then pay to *Identify* whatever needs it.

  In addition to Identifying objects, you also need to map the dungeon, detect
  traps, detect monsters and learn about unfamiliar monsters, especially
  uniques. There are magic items for all of these, so be on the lookout!

  [[[[B|Travel
  Finally, you don't need to climb up and down the stairs all the time to
  return to town. There is a magic item called Word of Recall (scrolls) or
  just Recall (devices) that will take you back and forth between the town
  and your current dungeon level. And this is a good thinng too since it would
  be rather onerous to walk up and down 100 flights of stairs in the end game!

***** <OnWeapons>
  [[[[r|On Weapons, Armor and Slays

  Potions, Scrolls and devices are not the only magical items around. You can
  also find magical armor and equipment. We already discussed resistances above,
  and magical equipment is the usual place to find these attributes. Magical
  weapons often are more deadly against certain enemies, an attribute known
  as slays.

  Your equipment will always carry around little numbers that tell you how
  effective it is. Armors take this form:

  A Robe (+x,+y) [a,+b] (+c)

  Weapons take this form:

  A Long Sword (XdY) (+x,+y) [+b] (+c)

  When unidentified, armors will show just this:

  A Robe [a]

  Weapons will show this:

  A Long Sword (XdY)

  What do all these numbers mean?
  [[[[B|(+x,+y)| This is the item's magical bonuses to your to-hit and to-damage
  bonus respectively. These are added to whatever other bonuses you have when
  you attack. Some armors have similar bonuses to your to-hit and to-damage, but
  they are mostly artifacts, the exceptions being Gloves/Gauntlets/Cesti of
  Slaying. Many body armors have a small negative number before the base armor
  bonus (see below); this is a penalty to your skill (the armor is so heavy
  that you have trouble moving around in it). However, this penalty is small
  enough for all but the youngest of characters to ignore.

  [[[[B|[a,+b]| This is the item's base armor class and magical bonus to armor.
  The higher, the better. While theoretically, a weapon could provide a base
  armor bonus, none of them do, and only a few weapons have a magical bonus to
  armor.

  [[[[B|(+c)| This is the item's magical bonus to other statistics.
  Possibilities include one or more of your stats (Strength, Intelligence,
  Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma), your speed or your stealth.
  Your searching or infravision might also be improved. There are other
  possibilities and learning the effects of this bonus often requires you
  to *Identify* the object.

  [[[[B|(XdY)| This is the damage dice of a melee weapon. When you hit an
  opponent, the game rolls a Y sided die X times to figure out a base damage.
  This base damage can be multiplied by any slays on the weapon, and also by
  critical hits (lucky blows on your part). Then, the game adds all the plusses
  to damage to the total, including the +y from the (+x,+y) discussed above.
  So a melee weapon can be good because it has good damage dice (e.g.
  (6d5) (+0, +0)) or because it has a high damage bonus (e.g. (1d4) (+5, +30)).
  Ideally, it would have both: (6d5) (+5, +30)!

  In addition to these attributes, all of which are revealed by Identify,
  weapons and armors may have additional bonuses. Both may grant a particular
  resistance that we discussed earlier. In additions, weapons often have slays
  that target a specific class of monster. Slays work by multiplying the base
  damage roll (The (XdY) just discussed), and the multiplier varies with the
  type of slay. For example, a weapon of Slay Orc multiplies the damage dice
  by a factor of 3, while a *Slay Orc* weapon might (I say, might!) multiply
  by as high a factor as 5. Obviously, this means more on a (6d5) weapon than
  on a (1d4) weapon, so the quality of a magical weapon depends heavily on
  the base type of the object (Daggers do 1d4 while Blades of Chaos do 6d5).
  You sometimes need to *Identify* a weapon to learn its slays. But sometimes
  it is obvious from the name of the object (Slay Orc) and you only need to
  Identify the weapon. Artifacts always required *Identify* to learn their
  attributes.

***** <OnExploration>
  [[[[r|On Dungeon Exploration

  We'll close this Newbie guide with some various tips on exploring the dungeon.

  [[[[B|On Secret Doors|

  Throughout the dungeon, many doors are hidden from view. To find them,
  use the (S)earch command, which toggles on and off the Searching mode.
  However, it is often difficult enough just knowing where to search.
  Usually, situations like this will have secret doors (walls containing
  secret doors are marked by *s):
 
  #*###  ###'###  ####*#    ###*###
  *@...  ..'@'..  ..@'.*    ..'@...
  #*###  ###*###  ####'#    #######
 
  In general, if you see a door by itself in a corridor, there are
  usually others nearby. If you find a corner in a corridor with two
  doors, look for more. Intersections often have some secret doors.
  Finally, secret doors will never be in a situation where you have to
  move diagonally to open them. The dead-end situation (the first one)
  usually does have a secret door, but not always. If you search for a
  while and don't find anything, just give up and move on. Sometimes a
  dead end will occur near the end of a map, where there is no room to
  have a continuing corridor, and so no secret door is generated.
 
  [[[[B|On Level Feelings|

  After you have been on a new level for a considerable length of time,
  you receive a feeling giving you a vague idea how good the level is.
  In general, the more scary the feeling sounds, the better the items on
  the level, or the more difficult the monsters. Probably the latter.
  Each unusual item or monster bumps up the rating of the level a bit. An
  item or monster is considered unusual if it is out of depth [normally
  occurs at a lower depth; for instance, a Longsword has a base level of
  20, and would be considered unusual anywhere above that level (although
  not below it)]. Items can be out of depth without necessarily being
  anything special; a normal, non-magical katana could provoke a high
  level feeling at low depths, because it is so unusual. Also, pits
  (large rooms filled with a single type of monster) and vaults (dense,
  dangerous rooms with many out of depth monsters and items) can cause
  high level feelings. There is also a Special feeling which tells the
  player that there is an artifact on the level.

  The speed at which you receive level feelings is influenced by your Wisdom,
  so if your big, stupid warrior seems to wait forever for level feeling,
  check out his Wisdom and maybe roll up a better one next time.
 
  [[[[B|On the Monster Memory|

  In many other games, you are required to take notes on monster's weaknesses,
  strengths, spells, etc. However, we are not so cruel as that, and will
  automatically take notes for you with the handy Monster Memory. Every time
  you find out something new about a monster, like that it can breathe fire,
  this is added to your knowledge of the monster. To look over this knowledge,
  type /, then the symbol of the monster. You may have to scroll through
  other monster memories to get to the one you're looking for. Or use the look
  ('l') and recall ('r') commands the next time you see one.

  In the unpleasant event of your character's death, you can create a new
  character using your old character's file (instead of simply creating a
  new character, open the dead character's savefile, and the Creating a
  Character section will come up). This new character will have all of
  the old one's monster memories, and some special text for the monster
  that killed him.

  [[[[B|On Death

  Death in PosChengband is permanent. Saving is meant only to let you pick up
  where you left off; if you die, your savefile is marked. The next time you
  try to use the savefile, you will get the new character dialogue. Ancestors
  of dead characters will retain their monster memory and preferences.
  Many people here have characters like "Yuppy XIV"; people die very often
  and death is common, so don't get discouraged. In general, you will kill
  monsters more often than they kill you!
 
***** <OnBigBoyPants>
  [[[[r|On Big Boy Pants

  When you are ready to move past Beginner Mode, the game will open up a
  huge variety of race and class options for you as well as giving you a full
  wilderness to explore. All of this is discussed in the remainder of the help
  system, so when you are ready to move on, be sure to check out the rest of
  the documentation. Pay special attention to sections on the wilderness as
  well as the various gameplay options. And when you're ready for a real treat,
  fire up a game in Monster Mode and play as a Cyberdemon!

  Have Fun! :)
