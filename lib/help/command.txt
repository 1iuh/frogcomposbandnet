  [[[[B|PosChengband Commands

  Commands are entered using the keyboard by pressing a single key that
  is mapped to an underlying command interpreted by the game. This mapping
  of keystrokes to game commands proceeds by using one of two standard
  keysets: the Original Keyset and the Roguelike Keyset. If you are playing
  for the first time, I recommend using the Original Keyset since it is the
  default and is also the most intuitive (for example, you move with the
  arrow keys). But there are also some crazy folks that prefer a different
  approach ... Just kidding. The Roguelike keyset might be more ergonomic
  since movement is controlled with normal alphabetic keys, but, personally,
  I could never train myself to switch.

  Once you've chosen a game command, you may be prompted for arguments or
  additional information. For example, if you get hungry and decide to eat
  some food ('E' in the Original Keyset), the game will give you a list
  of choices (which might include rations of food, or various mushrooms ...
  whatever relevant objects you have in your pack). You can cancel the command
  with the ESC key.

  This file contains the command mappings for the two keysets listed above.
  For an overview of the various commands, see [a]. Also, for beginners,
  there is a unified command menu that is very easy to use, and you can
  navigate the various commands with the cursor keys, ENTER and ESC. Each
  command lists the keystroke for the command, so you can explore and
  learn as you go. Simply press ENTER to get started (You may enable/disable
  this feature with the 'command_menu' option. For more on setting options,
  see [b]).

  Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer number of commands. Many are not often used
  or required, and I've tried to highlight the most common commands below. You
  should try to memorize those, but this is easy as most commands use a mnemonic
  just like the Eat command discussed above. By the way, the caret (^) character
  in the tables below indicates pressing the CTRL key.

***** <CommandCounts>
  [[[[r|Command Counts

  Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding
  them with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count
  expires, until you type any character, or until something significant
  happens, such as being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work
  to attack another creature. While the command is being repeated, the
  number of times left to be repeated will flash by on the line at the
  left of the screen. [[[[y|To give a count to a command, type 0, the repeat
  [[[[y|count, and then the command.

  Counted commands are very useful for searching or tunneling, as they
  automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may
  also terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing
  any character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a
  SPACE or ESCAPE which are always ignored as commands in case you type
  the command just after the count expires.

  You can tell the game to automatically use a repeat count of 99 with
  commands you normally want to repeat (open, disarm, tunnel, bash,
  alter, etc) by setting the "always_repeat" option. For more information
  on setting options, see [b].

***** <CommandArguments>
  [[[[r|Command Arguments

  Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction,
  an inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the
  symbol of a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of
  time, a quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you
  can hit return to choose the "default" response, or escape to cancel
  the command entirely.

  Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a "compass"
  direction using any of the "direction keys" shown above. Sometimes,
  you may specify that you wish to use the current "target", by pressing
  "t" or "5", or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing "*".

***** <SelectingObjects>
  [[[[r|Selecting and Inscribing Objects

  Many commands will also prompt for a particular object to be used. For
  example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the scrolls
  that you are carrying that you wish to read. In such cases, the
  selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet. The prompt will
  indicate the possible letters, and will also allow you to type the key
  "*", which causes all of the available options to be described. The
  list of choices will also be shown in the Choice window, if you are
  using a windows environment and windows are turned on. Often you will
  be able to press "/" to select an object from your equipment instead of
  your inventory. Pressing space once will have the same effect as "*",
  and the second time will cancel the command and run the "i" or "e"
  command.

  The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case
  letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately.
  If upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you
  are given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper
  case selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke.
  Also see the "!*" and "!x" inscriptions, below.

  For many commands, you can also use "-" to select an object on the
  floor where you are standing. This lets you read scrolls or quaff
  potions, for example, off the dungeon floor without picking them up.

  If you enter a number between 0 and 9, the first item engraved with
  "@#" where "#" is the number you entered will be selected. For example,
  if you have a shovel engraved with "@0" and you type "w" (for wield)
  and then 0, you will wield the shovel. This is very useful for macros
  (see below), since you can use this to select an object regardless of
  its location in your pack. Multiple numbers can be engraved on the same
  object; for example, if a sword is engraved with @1@0, then either "w1"
  or "w0" will wield it. Normally, you inscribe "@1@0" on your primary
  weapon, and "@2@0" on your digger or secondary weapon. Note that an
  inscription containing "@x#" will act like "@#" but only when the
  current "game command" is "x". Thus you can put "@z4" on a rod and
  "@u4" on a staff, and then use both "z4" and "u4" as desired.

  Note that any object containing "!x" in its inscription, where "x" is
  the current "game command" will induce a verification prompt whenever
  that object is selected. Thus, inscribing, say, "!f!k!d" on an object
  will greatly reduce the odds of you losing it by accident, and inscribing
  "!*" on an object will allow you to be very paranoid about the object.
  Note that "selling" and "dropping" both use the "d" command.  You can even
  repeat the inscription to invoke multiple verifications if you are truly
  paranoid. For example, having found, say, a potion of death,  you might
  inscribe "!q!q!q!q" just to be absolutely, positively certain you  don't
  accidently quaff the potion. And if you do, then your fingers are even
  fatter than mine!

  While we are talking about inscriptions, there are certain object effects
  that can be annoying. For example, (and I hope this doesn't spoil
  the game for you) there are objects which randomly teleport the player
  away. This can be useful if you are out of other means of teleportation,
  but most of the time it is just plain annoying. You are prompted for the
  teleport, of course, but having prompts come up randomly is disturbing,
  and you often plow through the prompt anyway since you were in the middle
  of doing something else. In this case, you may inscribe "." on the object
  to eliminate the random teleportation.

  Here is a summary of the effects of various example object inscriptions:

  [[[[r|Inscription Effect
  [[[[r|=========== =====================================================
  [[[[y|    @1|      Select this object whenever '1' is pressed in any cmd
  [[[[y|   @w7|      Select this object whenever '7' is pressed after 'w'
  [[[[y|    !*|      Verify using this object for all commands
  [[[[y|    !q|      Verify using this object for the 'q' command.
  [[[[y|    !!|      Notify when the item is fully recharged
  [[[[y|    =g|      Always pickup (get) this objects. Useful for ammo.
  [[[[y|     .|      Suppress prompt for random teleportation
  [[[[y|     $|      Suppress prompt for warning
