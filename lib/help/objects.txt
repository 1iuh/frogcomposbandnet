<style:title>Objects</style>

Objects are one of the most important elements in the game, and much of your effort will be devoted to getting better, and then even better, stuff. Whether they are potions to heal you during a difficult fight, scrolls to teleport you out of danger, armor to protect you from fire breathing dragons, or swords to slay the minions of evil, objects permeate every aspect of your journey from the safety of town to the halls of Oberon and finally to the lair of the dreaded Serpent of Chaos. Naked, you are nothing. Well equipped, and perhaps, just maybe, you will stand a chance.

There are various types of objects, each with its own symbol for display, and generally with its own command for use. These will be described fully in the reference section near the end of this document. For now, here is an informal introduction.

First, there are objects you may wield or wear as equipment. This includes melee weapons such as swords, axes, polearms (pikes, spears, glaives) and hafted weapons (flails, hammers, maces); armor such as suits of chain mail, shields, helmets, cloaks, gloves and boots; jewelry such as rings and amulets; and finally light sources, such as torches and lanterns. All of these sorts of objects must be equipped with the <color:keypress>w</color> command to wield or wear them. For much of the game, you will be trying to find better and better gear to wear: more deadly weapons, more protective armor, magic rings and artifacts of rare and mighty enchantments. Whatever you have at the moment, no matter how good, you can be relatively sure that something even better could be found if only you were lucky, or bold, enough to find it.

Next, there are objects you carry around in your pack for utility purposes, or as provisions. Of course, you need to eat: killing stuff is hard work! And so food is a staple of the well prepared adventurer. And, equally obvious, you need to be able to see in those dark, dank places where evil lurks, so you need oil to refuel your lantern, or spare torches should your current one run out. But even more that this, you will need magical objects to survive. These include spellbooks, if you are playing a magical class, scrolls which all but the stupidest may read, potions which any may drink, and magical devices. Potions, scrolls and magical devices (wands, rods and staves) each contain a single magical spell or effect which they may perform. Generally, these can be quite useful, such as healing you in a pinch, or teleporting you out of danger. Or they might be offensive powers (for devices) that destroy your enemies. Or the effects may be bad, placed there to thwart adventurers at the outset of their journies, just when they are the most vulnerable and most easily dispatched.

Finally, there is gold or treasure. If you are a dwarf, you will barely resist singing of your longing for the lost, ancient treasures of yore. Other players will find these objects just as useful, for gold is the currency of the realm, accepted by shopkeepers the whole world over. You can dig for gold, but don't lose sight of the real purpose of your quest: The enemies lie deeper, ever deeper. And should you linger too long in the shallow safety, their forces may grow to the point where none may challenge them.

Now, it is time to explain all you will need to know about objects during your adventures. We will begin with how you get objects, then discuss how you learn about their powers, and finally discuss how to use them. At the end, we will give a table of all the types of objects you might encounter, at a broad level. This is a helpfile, and not a spoiler page, so we won't be telling you all the objects that exist, and will scarcely even mention the artifacts and other excellent items you are likely to encounter ... should you survive long enough.

<topic:Acquisition><style:heading>Where Can I Get More Stuff?</style>

Every player is born with a few objects to get them started on their quest. Exactly what these objects are depends upon which class they are playing. For example, Warriors begin with a sword and some nice armor, while Mages begin with their starting spellbooks and a pitiful looking dagger. But every player starts with a small amount of gold as well. Since the game begins in town, the first place to look for stuff is in the various shops.

Each store in town sells a particular class of objects, from weapons and bows at the Weapon Smiths, to shields and suits of armor at the Armory, to spellbooks, wands and staves at the Magic Shop. And then there is the Black Market, an unregulated forum to buy and sell just about any object imaginable, but at highly exorbitant prices. Often, you can simply buy a really great object here, but you need to be quite rich indeed!

So shopping is the first place you will find new stuff. But you are on a quest, after all, and it is time to begin your adventures. And it is in the various dungeons of the world that the best treasures can be found (Where do you think the Black Market gets all its stuff, after all?). If you are lucky, or stealthy, you can find quite a few objects just laying on the ground in the various dungeon levels you explore. How did they get there? Perhaps they were dropped by other adventurers who no longer found them useful? Or perhaps, noticing the various skeletons lying about, you realize they once belonged to other adventurers like yourself? At any rate, there are not that many objects just laying about anyways, and truly good objects won't be left lying around for long. For, players are not the only creatures with a lust for treasure, and monsters too, have a taste for gold.

Many monsters you meet will be carrying one or more items about their person which you may retrieve from their corpse should you be skillful enough to defeat them. You may pick up objects by moving on top of them and using the <color:keypress>g</color>et command. By setting various options (see <link:option.txt#UserInterface>) you may choose to pick up items automatically or to be prompted before picking up objects. There is also a powerful, rule based object management system called The Mogaminator that you may want to learn about later in the game. This system allows you to more easily manage all the objects you encounter, either by destroying objects you have registered as junk, or by picking up objects you have registered as desirable (see <link:editor.txt>). In your quest to defeat The Serpent, should you succeed, you will likely find tens of thousands of objects along the way and it is nice to have an efficient, automatic way to deal with them.

Finally, perhaps the best way to get really good objects is to find a treasure vault. There are many types of vaults, and they are usually well guarded, both with traps and with monsters. The better the treasure, the more difficult it will be for you to defeat the guardian monsters, and many a brave adventurer learned too late that bravery, if foolish, can be deadly as well. (Of course, vaults can be burgled as well, as any hobbit can tell you).

<topic:Knowledge><style:heading>OK, I Found Something. What Does It Do?</style>

When you find an object, you won't know much about it. For example, you might find a "long sword (2d5)" (see the section on weapons below for an explanation of the 2d5). Here, you know the type of object, that it is a weapon, and that tells you that you can wield it, if so inclined. And since you've seen long swords before (they are quite common), you know roughly how deadly the average long sword is. But, is this one any good? Is it magical? Cursed? What other bonuses might it have? This object is what we call <color:keyword>Unidentified</color>, and you will usually want to learn more about it before deciding to use it, or even carry it about with you as you continue to explore (It is a bit heavy, after all).

Every character will eventually get a sense of the quality of unidentified objects in their pack. This ability is called <color:keyword>Pseudo-ID</color> and its speed (i.e., how long it takes to kick in) and strength (i.e., how much information it reveals) will depend upon your class and your wisdom. Early in the game, pseudo-id is your first line of defense against the onslaught of junk objects. Pick stuff up, wait a bit (while continuing to play, of course), and learn which objects are junk and which might be worthy of further investigation. See <link:objects.txt#Pseudo-ID> in the reference section below for more information about pseudo-id.

If you sense that an object might be useful, you will probably want to Identify the object. This requires magic to do, either as a spell if you are a Mage, or as an effect from a magical device such as a scroll or perhaps a staff. In the former case, you can afford to be less selective in the objects you identify, since you can always rest to regain mana, and then recast the spell as needed. In fact, as a Mage, you can often just identify everything you find, as you find it, and skip the potentially long wait for (not to mention the hassle of) pseudo-id. But for everybody else, it will usually require a scroll of identify to learn about an object. These are available in town, and are generally quite common. Still, they are not so common (or cheap) that you can afford to waste them on every object you find. You need to be a bit more selective than that!

Identifying an object reveals its full name, as well as its more obvious bonuses. This includes combat bonuses in accuracy and deadliness as well as armor bonuses in protectiveness (i.e., AC). The object's name tells you whether it is an ego item or even an artifact, and also (usually) tells you if the object is cursed or not. But Identify doesn't tell you everything about an object.

For many excellent and special objects, you will want to *Identify* the object as well. This reveals everything, absolutely everything, about an object, including any hidden bonuses and powers it may or may not have. And here too, there is a spell for this, but it is high level and rare, so unlikely to be available even for a Mage until much later in the game. Devices with this effect are also very rare and only found in the deep depths of the dungeon. And Scrolls of *Identify* are quite expensive, even if you can buy them in town. Fortunately, there is a town service to research an object in all of the towns except Outpost. It too, is rather pricey, but at least it is available as needed. If you are too poor for this, or are just starting out on your adventures, then you can always sell the object to learn about it. Of course, then you won't have the object, and might not be able to buy it back if you decide you want it after all, so this approach is not recommended. (Try a little patience, and stash the object in your home until you have more gold!).

Object Knowledge and Object Quality are related concepts (You gain kowledge about an object's quality). We've been discussing knowledge, so now it is time to turn our attention to quality.

<topic:Quality><style:heading>How Good is this Object, Anyway?</style>

The broad quality of a wearable object (i.e., equipment) is given by the strong version of psuedo-id. Objects are, in increasing/decreasing order of quality, one of average, good/bad, excellent/awful or special/terrible. What does this mean?

If you did some shopping, then you probably saw what average equipment looks like. For example, the Weapon Smiths might have inventory like the following:
<style:screenshot>
          Fasgul (Zombie)                         Weapon Smiths (30000)

</style>
Here, we see a bunch of different types of weapons, each of which is fully *Identified* (Objects in the town shops are always automatically *Identified*). But, they don't look very impressive! First of all, you can notice that each type of weapon has different damage dice, which means nothing more than that, for example, a 3d4 Bastard Sword is more deadly than a 1d7 Cutlass, since 3d4 (which means roll three four-sided dice) will give an average of 7.5 damage per strike, while 1d7 (which means roll a single seven-sided die, if such a thing could be imagined!) gives an average of 4 damage per strike. Each class of weapon has its own damage dice.

Next, you may notice that (+0,+0) is repeated over and over again. That's because all of these objects are <color:keyword>average</color>. Hey, the Weapon Smith is no wizard. He just forges weapons of average quality, but he might occasionally buy a magical weapon from some intrepid adventurer (like yourself!). The (+0,+0) simply gives the magical bonus to melee accuracy (the first number), which affects your ability to hit a monster with that weapon, and the magical bonus to damage (the second number), which gets added to the damage total rolled by the damage dice, should you actually land a blow with that weapon.

Objects can be magically enhanced, at which point they become <color:keyword>good</color> objects. This means nothing more than that (+0,+0) becomes something non-zero, giving you bonuses either to hit, or to damage, or both. For example, you might have noticed that <color:u>Short Bow (x3) (+3,+6)</color>. The (x3) is part of every average bow, and is called the <color:keyword>damage multiplier</color>. We'll discuss its meaning later when we discuss archery. But bows too have <color:keyword>combat bonuses</color> just like melee weapons, and they mean the same thing. Here, the bow gives +3 to hit (making you more skilled with archery), and +6 to damage (making you more deadly as well). That would be a nice starting bow to have, but, alas, it costs 1540 gp which is more than I have.

So, we've discussed average and good objects. What about excellent objects? And special objects? Excellent objects are called <color:keyword>ego items</color>, a term that has been around for a long time but whose origin I cannot guess. Let's just say they are magical objects of a certain broad class. For example, I'll break my normal rules about spoilers, and say that there exists an ego class of weapons of Slay Orc. They aren't particularly good ego items, so I haven't completely ruined the game by mentioning them (I hope). They are simply more deadly against orcs. For example, our 3d4 Bastard Sword, were it a weapon of slay orc, would do three times as much damage from the base damage roll against orcs. In other words, roll a four-sided die three times, add up the result, and multiply by three if the monster is an orc. Then add in the bonus to damage. This illustrates that ego weapons often give targetted slays that make the weapon more deadly against a certain class of monsters. Ego items in general can do lots of things, like boost your stats, give you resistances or other important abilities, or even activate for various magical effects.

Ego items, as I said, come as a single instance of a broad class of objects, each of which will have the same set of bonuses, and perhaps a random bonus as well just to keep egos interesting. In this respect, they behave like flavored objects (discussed in the next section). Initially, your character will not know anything about the various ego item types (even if *you* do, though some obvious ones like Slay Orc are known to all right off the bat). Instead, the character needs to *identify* an instance of a particular ego type in order to become aware of that type, learning the stock bonuses shared by all objects of that ego type (but not the random bonuses). So *identify* is an important way to learn the various ego types, and you usually only need to do it on the first one you find. (This is one case where selling an object to learn its ego type is actually a useful strategy, provided you don't think you would otherwise want the object).

<color:keyword>Special</color> objects are artifacts. Think of these as unique super-ego objects: You can only find them once in a particular game and they tend to be substantially more powerful than ordinary ego items. Like egos, they typically give bonuses to combat as well as slays (if they are a weapon), or bonuses to armor class and resistances (if they are armor) as well as possible bonuses to your stats and other abilities. You will generally want to *identify* every artifact you find, unless you happen to be a veteran player who has already memorized all of the artifacts. But even then, like egos, artifacts sometimes common with additional random bonuses like an extra resistance, or an extra ability. *Identify* is your friend.

Finally, we've talked about the good end of the spectrum (average -> good -> excellent -> special). What about the evil end of the spectrum (average -> bad -> awful -> terrible)? These objects are <color:keyword>cursed</color>, but they need not be junk. Unlike other variants, cursed objects work a little differently in this game. Well, bad objects are just the opposite of good ones, so they really are junk most of the time. But awful objects are excellent items (i.e., ego items) that happen to have some bad attributes added in as well. And terrible items are special items (i.e., artifacts) that similarly add bad attributes on top of the good. Whether or not these items remain useful is up to you to decide, since they always blend good attributes with bad attributes. Sometimes they are junk, and other times the good outweighs the bad. In either case, you will need *identify* to discover this information. Oh, and cursed items also usually have a <color:keyword>gotcha</color> mechanic, that I suppose I better not mention. I'll just caution you to be careful around cursed objects.

We've talked a lot about equipment, but what about other kinds of objects? Their quality too might vary. Let's discuss some of these other object types first.

<topic:Flavors><style:heading>Object Flavors</style>

Some objects come in <color:keyword>flavors</color>. For example, you might find a Black Spotted mushroom, or a Bubbling potion. The description of the unidentified object is termed its flavor, and all objects of a given kind have the same flavor for the duration of a given game. For example, that Black Spotted mushroom might cause hallucinations, as some mushrooms have been known to do. Next time you find a Black Spotted mushroom, you will know to avoid it since it too will cause hallucinations. But the flavors <color:keyword>shuffle</color> each game you play. If they didn't then once you learned the flavor of hallucination mushrooms in one game, you'd know it for all time, and where would the fun be in that?

Currently, the only flavored objects are mushrooms, potions and scrolls (We used to have more, including rings, amulets, wands, rods and staves, but I've waged a sort of mini-crusade against flavors for a number of reasons which I won't discuss). Each instance of a flavor is exactly like every other instance of the flavor, and typically, you only need Identify to learn the flavor (though you can also try to use the object to learn what it is ... This can be risky!). You won't find <color:keyword>good</color> or <color:keyword>excellent</color> or <color:keyword>special</color> objects here. Each instance of a flavor is exactly like every other instance. The early game is heavily dominated by learning many, many different flavors of marginally useful or even downright useless objects. This is one reason for junk management tools like The Mogaminator.

<topic:Flavors><style:heading>Jewelry</style>

While rings and amulets are wearable objects, they behave a little bit differently than weapons and armor. For one thing, there is no such thing as <color:keyword>good</color> jewelry. Either an item is average (in which case you might consider it junk, unless you plan on reforging artifacts later in the game) or it is excellent/awful. Excellent rings and amulets are like ordinary ego items in that they are instances of a broad class: the ego type. However, they are a bit different in that the ego type determines the theme of the object: its set of allowed attributes. But each piece of jewelry is almost entirely random, generated with one or more attributes from the allowed set. This means the quality of the item is highly variable, and generally increases the deeper you descend.

Another difference with jewelry is that identify actually *identifies* the item as well. This is because the there are no stock attributes for each ego type, so that normal identify semantics would do very little more than reveal the objects name (and combat/ac bonuses, if any). You would almost always need *identify* anyway, and this can be a bit tedious to do for every single piece of jewelry you find.

The final difference is that you won't find random artifact jewelry. Instead, there are a small number of fixed standard artifacts available. However, the various ego types can become amazingly powerful so you don't really need artifacts here. And given the themed nature of the egos, they are really behaving like mini-rand-arts anyway.

<topic:Flavors><style:heading>Devices</style>

Magical devices include wands, staves and rods. I highly recommend you head on over to the Magic Store and e<color:keypress>x</color>amine a few to get a feel for how devices work, as this area of the game has been extensively modified for the current release (4.0.0).

Since these are available in town, I'll talk you through one example in detail without much of a guilty conscience over spoilers. For example, I examined the following wand:
<style:screenshot>
<color:g>a Wand: </color><color:G>Stinking Cloud</color>
  <color:U>This device has the following magical strength:</color>
  Power  : <color:G>13</color>
  Mana   : <color:y>10</color>/<color:G>39</color>

  <color:U>This device is loaded with a spell:</color>
  Spell  : <color:B>Stinking Cloud</color>
  Info   : dam 15
  Level  : <color:G>8</color>
  Cost   : <color:G>4</color>
  Charges: <color:y>2</color>/<color:G>9</color>
  Fail   : <color:G>2.4%</color>
  Desc   : It fires a ball of poison.
</style>
It will help a little bit if you are already familiar with spellcasters and the magic system, since the best way to think of devices is as spellcasters that may cast a single spell. The device has a casting level (labelled as <color:keyword>Power</color>) and <color:keyword>Mana</color>, just like a normal spellcaster. And the single spell they are loaded with has a <color:keyword>spell level</color> and <color:keyword>casting cost</color> just like normal spells. The power of the effect, damage in this case, is solely determined by the power level of the device and has nothing whatsoever to do with the player's level.

<topic:Flavors><style:heading>Spellbooks</style>

<topic:Pseudo-ID><style:heading>Reference: Pseudo-ID</style>

To review, pseudo-id is the ability to get a rough idea of the quality of objects you carry in your pack (or wield, if you are truly intrepid!). The speed and strength of the sensing varies with class, wisdom, and virtue of the player. Also, once a player reaches CL35, they automatically sense the quality of objects underfoot, and this automatic sensing is always strong regardless of class. So pseudo-id is really only relevant in the early to mid-game.

Pseudo-id communicates the quality of an object via a fake inscription on that object. For example, you might have a Long Sword (2d5) {excellent} or Hard Studded Leather [7] {terrible}. The meaning of these adjectives depends on whether the sensing is strong or weak, and is given in the following two tables.
  <indent>
<color:o>Table 1 - Strong Pseudo-Id</color>
<color:G>Inscription    Meaning</color>
Terrible       a cursed artifact
Awful          a cursed ego item
Bad            a cursed nameless item
Average        an average item
Good           an enchanted item
Excellent      a good ego item
Special        an non-cursed artifact

Or, to put this another way:

                   <color:G>Egos         Artifacts</color>
Average -> Good -> Excellent -> Special
        -> Bad  -> Awful     -> Terrible


<color:o>Table 2 - Weak Pseudo-Id</color>
<color:G>Inscription    Meaning</color>
Average        an average item
Cursed         <indent>a cursed item (includes cursed ego items and artifacts)</indent>
Enchanted      <indent>an enchanted item (includes good ego items and artifacts)</indent>
</indent>

The dungeons are full of objects and many monsters you meet will be carrying one or more items about their person which you may retrieve from their corpse should you be skillful enough to defeat them. You may pick up objects by moving on top of them. By setting various options (see <link:option.txt#UserInterface>) you may choose to pick up items automatically or to be prompted before picking up objects.

Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands for their use. Wands must be 'a'imed, staves must be 'u'sed, scrolls must be 'r'ead, and potions must be 'q'uaffed. You may, in general, not only use items in your pack, but also items on the ground, if you are standing on top of them.

You can carry up to 26 different objects in your backpack while wearing and wielding up to 12 others. Items you wear and wield are referred to as your 'equipment' while items contained in your backpack are referred to as your 'inventory'. You may view a list of your current inventory and equipment at any time by using the 'i' and 'e' commands respectively.

<style:note>Note: Some races have varying body types, so the exact number and kinds of equipment may vary.</style>

Although you are limited to a fixed number of different items in your inventory, each item may actually be a 'pile' of up to 99 similar items. This allows you to carry multiple spell books, rations of food and other essential items while not using up all your inventory slots. If you somehow manage to stuff too many items into your pack, for example, by removing an item from your head while your pack is full, then your pack will 'overflow' and the most recently added item will fall out and onto the ground. You will be warned about any command that seems likely to induce this behavior.

In addition to the number of different items you may carry, you are also limited in the total amount of weight that you can carry. As you approach this value, you become slower, making it easier for monsters to chase you. Note that there is no upper bound on how much you can carry, if you do not mind being slow. The amount you may carry before becoming slowed is determined by your strength. For this purpose, the weight of both your equipment and your inventory is taken into consideration.

Because of these space and weight constraints, it is important that a player learns to manage his inventory efficiently. You must juggle carefully the need for carrying essential items such as food, fuel for your light source, spellbooks (if applicable), healing items, escaping items, and the 101 other things necessary for your survival while at the same time maintaining space to carry back treasure from the dungeon for sale in the town and ensuring that you do not exceed your weight limit. Note that the additional powers and abilities some objects can grant the player are only effective when they are wielded. A Shield of Resist Acid, for example, will not protect you from the effects of acid while it is in your backpack.

<topic:Generation><style:heading>Object Generation</style>

Objects are generated when you enter a dungeon level and spread liberally around the dungeon floor. They may also be generated when a monster is killed (assuming the monster is capable of carrying objects). Each object has a 'native' depth or a depth at which it begins to be commonly found in the dungeon. It is unusual, though not impossible, to find objects significantly shallower in the dungeon than their native depths.

Which items are generated at the creation of the level or by the death of a monster is determined by a number of factors including the current dungeon level, the monster's native level and the native depth of the object being considered for generation. The quality of the object, in the case of monster drops, is also affected by the guaranteed quality level (if any) of that monster's drop.

Monster drops are either normal, 'good' or 'great'. While these terms generally refer to equipment such as weapons and armor (for example, a 'good' drop means that any equipment generated is guaranteed to have magical pluses and a 'great' drop means that any equipment generated is guaranteed to be either an ego item or an artifact), they also encompass certain other objects. For example, high level spellbooks and Rings of Speed are all considered as being 'great' objects and may therefore be dropped by a monster with a 'great' drop. Note that some monsters may drop treasure rather than objects.

<topic:CursedObjects><style:heading>Cursed Objects</style>

A goodly percentage of the items generated in the dungeon or dropped by monsters will be cursed. Most cursed items will have penalties to various things such as your skill and deadliness or your armor class. They may also have other undesirable attributes.

Should you wield a cursed item, you will be prompted by the message "Oops, it feels deathly cold!" and the item will be automatically inscribed as being {cursed}. Once wielded, a cursed item may not be taken off until it has been uncursed. Uncursing an object will allow it to be removed but will not remove the negative effects such as the penalties mentioned above.

There are several ways to uncurse objects. The Life realm contains two spells (one stronger than the other) for the purpose. There are also scrolls that you may find or purchase from the Temple which are similar to these prayers in their effect. It is also possible that in the course of enchanting an item you may lift a curse as a side-effect the enchanting process although this is not guaranteed to happen.

  <indent><color:o>The Curses</color>

There are several different types of curse and more than one may be present on a single object although this is rare.

<color:r>Light Curse</color>
A lightly cursed item will typically have penalties to armor class, skill and deadliness, and various other things as appropriate. It may be uncursed reading a Scroll of Remove Curse or by the weaker Life realm prayer.

<color:r>Heavy Curse</color>
A heavily cursed item will typically have penalties to armor class, skill and deadliness, and various other things as appropriate. It may be uncursed reading a Scroll of *Remove Curse*. or by the stronger Life realm prayer.

<color:r>Permanent Curse</color>
Items that are permanently cursed may not be uncursed and so may not be removed once worn. You may occasionally find objects that are permanently cursed and which you are tempted to wield. Think carefully before you do so because you probably won't get a chance to change your mind.
</indent>

<topic:AncientCurse><style:heading>The Ancient and Foul Curse</style>

The Ancient and Foul Curse is sometimes referred to incorrectly as 'The Curse of Topi Ylinen' after the person who first created it. Unlike the other curses discussed above, an object with the Ancient and Foul Curse can be removed at any time and as a result you will not get the "Oops, it feels deathly cold!" prompt when wielding it (unless, of course, it also has one of the other curses in which case both these behaviors will be present as a consequence of the secondary curse(s)).

While the item is wielded, the curse will be randomly invoked every so often. When invoked, the curse may have one or more of several possible effects in various combinations. Fortunately, some of the worst of such combinations such as being paralyzed while Cyberdemons are summoned around you are prevented from happening. Some possible effects of the curse include: summoning monsters, summoning Cyberdemons, paralyzation (even with Free Action), teleporting the player, removing the walls around the player, amnesia, decreasing one or more primary stats both temporarily and permanently among others.

Note: Although the Ancient and Foul Curse is primarily found on objects, there are a number of other occasions where you might fall foul of it. These include as side effects of miss-cast spells, setting off certain traps, as a 'reward' from a chaos-warrior's patron and as the dying curse of an Amberite.

<topic:ObjectFlavors><style:heading>Object Flavors</style>

Some objects (scrolls, potions, and mushrooms) are 'flavored items'. This means that with each game they are given a random flavor. For example, the first time you find a Potion of Heroism it might be described as a 'Dark Blue Potion'.  Once you have identified it, the potion will be described as a 'Dark Blue Potion of Heroism'. Flavors vary from game to game so your next character might discover that that same Dark Blue Potion is now something entirely different. This means that each new character must set about learning exactly what each flavored items is.

One of the game options allows the player to switch to 'plain' object descriptions which removes the flavored description from known flavored items so that the potion above, once identified, would be described simply as a 'Potion of Heroism'.

<topic:PseudoID><style:heading>Pseudo-ID</style>

Occasionally, as you wander around the dungeon you will sense something about the quality of an item or items you are wielding or carrying in your backpack. This sensing ability is called 'pseudo-id'. The speed and accuracy of your pseudo-id ability depends on a number of factors but the primary considerations are your class and level. Pseudo-id speed can be 'slow', 'medium' or 'fast' and, in addition, might be either 'strong' or 'weak'.

When you pseudo-id an item, it will be inscribed (see <link:objects.txt#Inscriptions> below) with the quality level you have determined it to be of. This inscription will remain until you identify it (see <link:objects.txt#Identifying> below) at which time it will be removed. The various inscriptions and their meanings are as follows:
  <indent>
<color:B>Table 1 - Strong Pseudo-Id</color>
<color:G>Inscription    Meaning</color>
Terrible       a cursed artifact
Awful          a cursed ego item
Bad            a cursed nameless item
Average        an average item
Good           an enchanted item
Excellent      a good ego item
Special        an non-cursed artifact

Or, to put this another way:

                   <color:G>Egos         Artifacts</color>
Average -> Good -> Excellent -> Special
        -> Bad  -> Awful     -> Terrible


<color:B>Table 2 - Weak Pseudo-Id</color>
<color:G>Inscription    Meaning</color>
Average        an average item
Cursed         <indent>a cursed item (includes cursed ego items and artifacts)</indent>
Enchanted      <indent>an enchanted item (includes good ego items and artifacts)</indent>
</indent>
Early in the game, pseudo-id is your first line of defense against the onslaught of junk objects. Pick stuff up, wait a bit (while continuing to play, of course), and learn which objects are junk and which might be worthy of further investigation. At this point, you will want to Identify the object.

<topic:Identifying><style:heading>Identifying Objects</style>

Although each player may, to a lessor or greater extent, rely on their pseudo-id ability to ascertain the quality of some items. For the most part you will need to identify them before you can determine how much use they will be to you. There are several methods of identifying items available to you. These include Scrolls of Identify and *Identify*, Staves and Rods of Perception, spells and prayers and services from town buildings among others.

There is an important difference between 'identify'ing an object and '*identify*'ing an object. 'Identify'ing an object will reveal its correct description (including ego type where applicable), any plusses to combat or armor class and its bonus to stats and abilities (its 'pval') if it has one. '*Identify*'ing an item will reveal all information about an object including its additional fixed and random abilities if any. Once *Identified*, you may review the full abilities of an object by using the 'I'nspect command.

Another means of identifying flavored items it to sell them to a shop. Having purchased the item, the shopkeeper will inform you what it is that you have sold. This can be a useful technique in the early game but exposes you to the risk of selling an unidentified item that had been generated out of depth and which you might have preferred to keep for yourself.

Note: you will automatically have full knowledge about any item that you purchase in the town.

<topic:EgoObjects><style:heading>Ego Objects</style>

In addition to the ordinary weapons and armor your character may find in the dungeon, some of them may be endowed with additional powers. These objects fall into three types: (b) artifacts which are dealt with below and can be identified by their name; (c) Ego Weapons which are described more fully in Attacking Monsters (see <link:attack.txt#EgoArtifact>); and (d) Ego Armors which are discussed more fully in Defending Yourself (see <link:defend.txt#EgoArtifact>).

Unlike artifacts which are unique and may only be found once in each game, it is not unusual to find several Ego Weapons or Ego Armor of the same type during the course of a character's adventures.

Note that some Ego Armor types are limited to only certain types of armor. For example, you can find a Shield of Reflection but not Boots of Reflection.

<topic:Artifacts><style:heading>Artifacts</style>

Of all the objects that you might find, by far the most important group are artifacts.  Artifacts are unique items with additional properties such as increasing or sustaining one or more of your stats and granting resistances or abilities. Often an artifact can be 'A'ctivated for a magical effect. These can be Extremely useful - especially for classes that are weak in magic.

There are two types of artifacts - fixed and random. The fixed artifacts each have entries in the lib/edit/a_info.txt file and consequently have a chance of appearing in each game you play. On the other hand, random artifacts are created by the game and have both random names and random properties. Once created, there is only a vanishingly small chance you will ever see one exactly the same again.


  <indent><color:o>Preserve Mode</color>

One important thing to note when considering artifacts is your initial choice of (non-)preserve mode. in non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either on the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be generated again during that game. This means that if you miss the artifact by leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone forever. On the other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only exhibited once you have identified the artifact. It is therefor safer to leave a level before it is completely explored as any fixed artifact can be regenerated in subsequent levels.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Special feelings</color>

If you have stayed on the previous level long enough, on entering a new level you will receive a 'feeling' which reflects the quality of the monsters and objects on the level. Feelings are discussed in more detail in the Town and Dungeon section. One possible feeling is 'You have a special feeling about this level'. This message is only given when playing in non-preserve mode and is an indicator that you have either a monster pit, vault or artifact on the level. Artifacts always cause special feelings but pits and vaults are increasingly less likely to do so as you get deeper in the dungeon. At very deep levels, special feelings are almost always artifacts.

Note: In non-preserve mode, you can still find artifacts on levels that did not give a special feeling but these will always be the result of a monster dropping them.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>The '~' Command</color>

By pressing '~' and choosing the option for artifacts, you can see what fixed (but not random) artifacts you have found so far. In non-preserve mode, this option will also show which fixed (but not random) artifacts you have missed. However, in this case, it will show nothing about fixed artifacts on the current dungeon level but not yet found and as a result is often best used on the town level.</indent>

<topic:Inscriptions><style:heading>Object Inscriptions</style>

You may "inscribe" any object with a textual inscription of your choice. These inscriptions are not limited in length, though you may not be able to see the whole inscription on the item. The game applies special meaning to inscriptions containing any text of the form "@#" or "@x#" or "!x" or "!*" (see <link:command.txt#ObjectSelection>) .

The game provides some "fake" inscriptions to help you keep track of your possessions. Wands and staves which are known to be empty will be inscribed with "empty". Objects which have been tried at least once but haven't been identified yet will be inscribed with "tried". Cursed objects are inscribed with "cursed". Broken objects may be inscribed with "broken". Also, any item which was purchased at a discount, implying that it is slightly "sub-standard", will be inscribed with the appropriate "discount", such as "25% off". Note that these inscriptions are fake, and cannot be removed, though they can be covered up by a real inscription if you so desire. Try "_" as a nice short one.

  <indent><color:o>Making use of Inscriptions</color>

Some players use the inscription feature to record useful and/or interesting facts about an object such as where and how it was acquired or what its abilities and powers are. There is also a feature to automatically inscribe the abilities of items for you.

In addition to this, inscriptions can be used in far more powerful ways. Many commands in PosChengband require you to specify an object from your inventory such as which potion you wish to 'q'uaff or which staff you wish to 'u'se.  Inscriptions offer a powerful way of managing this and provide a useful labor saving tool.</indent>


  <indent><color:o>Auto Inscription of Resistances and Powers</color>

When you inscribe {%all} on an *identified* object, the '%all' will automatically transforms and changes into a string which describe its resistances and powers.  For example, when you inscribe {%all} on a robe of Resistance which has resistance to four elements and an extra resistance to Nether, the inscription will change into {AcElFiClNt}. The 'Ac' is abbreviation of resistance to ACid, while El, Fi, Cl and Nt are resistances to ELectricity, FIre, CoLd and NeTher.

On the other hand, when you inscribe {%} on an *identified* object, the {%} will transform to a string which describes only its extra resistances. In the example above, the inscription will become {Nt}, meaning the extra resistance of Nether.

  <indent><color:o>The {@x#} Inscription</color>

The {@x#} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific command and '#' is an object tag (number or alphabet)) is, perhaps the most commonly used inscription. When you select command 'x', followed by the tag '#', the game searches for an object with the inscription {@x#} and performs that command upon it. Thus if the player inscribes a Potion of Healing as {@q1}, then pressing 'q1' will quaff it automatically. This feature is useful because as items are added or removed from your inventory, the actual slot that they are in changes. However, the inscription will work regardless of the position.

Note that you can inscribe multiple different objects with the same inscription {@x#}. If you do so, the command 'x#' will act on the first appropriately inscribed object in your inventory list and not on each of them.

Also note that you can place multiple such inscriptions on a single object. So that a spell book might be inscribed {@ma@ba@Ga} since the cast spell, browse book, and gain spell commands each require a spell book reference as an argument. You can also inscribe the same command more than one so that food item might be inscribed {@E1@E2}

<color:B>Example 1:</color> <indent>You have a primary weapon and a shovel. You normally use the weapon but want to use the shovel for mining treasure. Inscribe your primary weapon with {@w0} and your shovel with {@w1}. Then, when you want to wield your shovel, you can press 'w1' and to re-wield your sword you can press 'w0' regardless of where in the inventory they are located at the time.

Note: you can also inscribe both weapons with {@w0} and just press 'w0' whenever you want to exchange weapon and shovel.</indent>

<color:B>Example 2:</color> <indent>To cast the first spell from your first spell book, you would normally type 'maa' and to cast the first spell from the second book, you would type 'mba'.  However, if your first book is stolen or destroyed, pressing 'mba' would no longer cast the spell you wanted. People often cast the wrong spells in such situation.  To prevent such mistake, you can inscribe your first spellbook with {@ma}, second spellbook with {@mb}, etc.  Cast spells by typing 'maa', 'mba', etc.  Even if your other spell books are lost, you will never need to worry about casting the wrong spell.</indent>

<color:B>Example 3:</color> <indent>You are carrying some Rations of Food and some Elvish Waybread. You wish to use up the Rations first before eating the Waybread, but also want to be able to use the healing/curing properties of the Waybread in an emergency. You would inscribe the Rations with {@E1} and the Waybread with {@E1@E2}. Since the Rations appear before the Waybread on the inventory listing, typing 'E1' will ensure you eat all the Rations first before touching the Waybread but that you only ever have to press E1 to eat. But, pressing 'E2' will bypass the Rations and jump to the Waybread. Some players also do similar things with cure and healing potions.</indent>
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {@#} Inscription</color>

The {@#} inscription (where '#' is a number from 0 to 9) is similar to the {@x#} inscription, but it works for any command, and any alphabet letters cannot be used as a tag.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {!x} Inscription</color>

The {!x} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific command) will induce "verification" whenever that object is "selected". Thus, inscribing {!f!k!d} on an object will greatly reduce the odds of you "losing" it by accident. This is because any attempt to throw it ('f'), destroy it ('k') or drop it ('d') will prompt you to verify whether or not you really wish to take that action.

Note that inscribing {!*} on an object will prompt you to verify any action thus you allowing you to be very paranoid about the object. Also note that "selling" and "dropping" both use the "d" command so that inscribing an item with {!d} will also prevent you from selling it by accident.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {^x} Inscription</color>

The {^x} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific command) will induce verification before taking that action. One common example of its usage is to inscribe boots with {^<^>} which will verify the user's command to leave the level via the staircases before actually doing so.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {=g} Inscription</color>

The {=g} inscription on an object prompts PosChengband to automatically pick it up. This instruction overrides any auto-pickup options chosen chosen by the player (if necessary). The primary purpose is to allow easy retrieval of missiles such as arrows and bolts once they have been fired at a target.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {#anystring} Inscription</color>

The {#anystring} inscription is used to make an item look like an artifact. For example, a Long Sword (2d5) (+10,+10) which is inscribed as {#of Hoge} is displayed as 'a Long Sword of Hoge (2d5) (+10,+10)'.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {!!} Inscription</color>

The {!!} Inscription on a rod or artifact tells the game to report you when the object is recharged and became activatable again.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {.} Inscription</color>

The {.} Inscription on a equipment which has ability of random teleportaion prevents the game from asking you whether you want to teleport or not on random chance, and the game automatically decide not to teleport.  But the ability of random teleportation has another function which allows you to follow a teleporting monster; this function will not be disabled.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>The {$} Inscription</color>

The {$} Inscription on a equipment which has ability of warning completely disables the warning ability.
</indent>

<topic:ObjectTypes><style:heading>The Object Types</style>

  <indent><color:o>Ammunition (<color:s>{</color>)</color>
Ammunition of various types and quality is a frequent find in the dungeon and is usually found in 'piles'. In order to get the full benefit from ammunition it must be 'f'ired from the appropriate missile launcher but me also be thrown. Slings fire pebbles and shots, bows fire arrows and crossbows fire bolts.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Missile Launchers (<color:U>}</color>)</color>
There are several types of missile launchers from slings to heavy crossbows. Each type of launcher has its own ammunition (see above). Missile launchers must be 'w'ielded before they can be used and will be placed in the 'b' equipment slot.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Weapons (<color:o>/</color><color:W>|</color><color:B>\</color>)</color>
There are numerous types of weapons in the dungeons. Each weapon varies in terms of its weight and based damage dice. Weapons must be 'w'ielded before they can be used.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Armor (<color:s>[</color><color:U>(</color><color:s>)</color><color:U>]</color>)</color>
Armor may be worn on your body, cloaks may worn about your body, shields may be worn on either arm, head gear (caps, helms and crowns) are worn on your head, gloves and gauntlets and cesti are worn on your hands, and boots are worn on your feet. Armor of any kind must be 'w'ielded before it can be used.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Amulets (<color:y>"</color>)</color>
Amulets are flavored items and are worn around your neck and must be 'w'ielded before they can be used.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Rings (<color:g>=</color>)</color>
Rings are flavored items. You may wear one ring each of your left and your right hand and must be 'w'ielded before they can be used.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Scrolls (?)</color>
Scrolls are flavored items which must be 'r'ead to benefit from their effect. Most scrolls serve utility purposes.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Potions (<color:B>!</color>)</color>
Potions are flavored items and must be 'q'uaffed before they have an effect on you. Some potions may be thrown at monsters and will have an effect on them when the potion shatters. Similarly, you may occasionally be carrying a potion which shatters during combat and thus spreading its effects on the monsters around you.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Food (<color:U>,</color>)</color>
Various food items are scattered throughout the dungeons and must be 'E'aten for the player to gain nutritional value. If you do not eat regularly you will become hungry and then weak. Eventually, you will begin to faint from hunger and will finally die of starvation.

Note: undead races gain little or no nutritional value from food and must therefore obtain nourishment in some other manner.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Mushrooms (<color:U>,</color>)</color>
Mushrooms are a flavored food item that grant nutritional value and also have a magical effect on the player. As you might expect, not all of these are beneficial. They must be 'E'aten.

Note: undead races will get little or no nutritional value from eating mushrooms but will experience any magical effects.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Wands (<color:B>-</color>)</color>
Wands are flavored, magical devices containing a finite number of 'charges'. Each charge represents a single use of the wand and using the wand reduces the number of charges available by one. Once empty, the wand must be 'recharged' before it can be used again. In general, wands will fire a bolt, beam or ball rather than have an area affect. Wands do not normally affect the player directly and are generally useful for attacking purposes. Wands must be 'a'imed and most wands will require a target.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Staves (<color:U>_</color>)</color>
Staves are a flavored item and are made of various types of wood. Like wands, they contain a limited number of charges and must be recharged when empty. In general, staves have an area affect or act on the player. Unlike wands, few staves may be used directly for offense. Staves must be 'u'sed and do not require a target.</indent>
    
  <indent><color:o>Rods (<color:r>-</color>)</color>
Rods are similar to both wands and staves in that many magical effects available from wands and staves are also available from rods. The main difference is that a rod carries a single charge but over time will recharge itself. Typically, the better the rod, the longer it will take to recharge itself. This means you have an unlimited supply of the magical effect but can only use it infrequently compared to a wand or staff which can be used each turn until it is empty. Rods must be 'z'apped and many rods will require a target.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Spellbooks (<color:R>?</color>)</color>
There are four spell books for each of the magic realms and which are found either in the shops or at varying depths in the dungeons. If you are a spellcaster, you may 'b'rowse any book which belonging to your chosen realm(s) to see what spells it contains. You may not browse books from realms other than those that your character has chosen. You may learn new spells with the 'G' command and cast them with the 'm' command.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Chests (<color:o>&</color>)</color>
Chests are complex objects, containing traps, locks, and possibly treasure or other objects inside them once they are opened. Many of the commands that apply to traps or doors also apply to chests and, like traps and doors, these commands do not work if you are carrying the chest.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Magical Figurines (<color:b>`</color>)</color>
A figurine is a small magical replica of a monster from the dungeon. When a figurine is thrown, a pet of the figurine's monster type will be generated.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Statues (<color:o>`</color>)</color>
Statues made of various materials can be found throughout the dungeon. Unlike figurines, they have no magical attributes but may be worth selling depending upon the material from which they are made.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Corpses (<color:D>~</color>)</color>
You may sometimes find the corpses and skeletons of monsters and other adventurers that have died in the dungeons.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Various Junk (<color:r>~</color>)</color>
Like any dungeon, you should expect to find various junk items like broken sticks, empty bottles, etc. lying around. While most of this junk is useless, iron spikes can be used to 'j'am doors to prevent a monster from chasing you.</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Light Sources (<color:U>~</color>)</color>
Various light sources and their fuel may also be found in the dungeon. You may refill your light source if you are carrying the appropriate items by using the 'F' command. Lanterns can be filled with flasks of oil and torches combined with other torches.</indent>
