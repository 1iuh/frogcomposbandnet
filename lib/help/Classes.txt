  <indent><topic:Berserker><color:o>Berserker</color>
A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and paralysis. At high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells with their tough flesh. Furthermore, they can fight without weapons, can remove cursed equipment by force, and can even use their special combat techniques when surrounded by an anti-magic barrier. Berserkers, however, cannot use any magical devices or read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat skills. Since Berserker Spectres are quite easy to *win* with, their scores are lowered.
 
Berserkers use a unique system of techniques called 'Rage'. They gain more techniques as they gain levels. They use no magic: indeed, they cannot use any magic devices or activate any artifacts, and cannot read scrolls. To offset these great disadvantages, Berserkers are allowed to have an important class power - 'Recall'.

<topic:Blood-Knight><color:o>Blood-Knight</color>
A Blood-Knight is a fighter who has delved into the dark arts and can perform a limited number of offensive effects using his own health. In addition to the HP cost, using an ability also causes bleeding/wounds, with an amount proportional to the cost of the ability. Their primary stat for abilities is Con.
 
Blood-Knights are strong in melee, but are very unusual in the fact that the more wounded they are, the stronger they become. When damaged, they gain additional melee attacks and damage, and moreso the more wounded and cut they become. Indeed, when on the brink of death they are the strongest fighters imaginable, and stories of their legendary feats abound. Of course, with great power comes great risk of death, and you don't recall ever meeting one of these heroes of legend in person!
 
Since the Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for their power, they are restricted to only certain races. No non-living race may walk the red path.

<topic:Duelist><color:o>Duelist</color>
The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at a severe disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes. When facing an enemy, the duelist first issues a challenge, marking that foe for a one on one duel. Of course, this wakes the monster up (There is no honor in dueling a sleeping enemy). And while the duelist will honor the fight as a one on one affair, many monsters have no such scruples.
 
Against a challenged foe, the duelist is very strong gaining a bonus to saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat prowess. On the other hand, due to the single-mindedness of their focus, the duelist is quite vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. Most of the techniques of this class aim at enforcing the sanctity of the duel.
 
The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make the most of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain experience. Able to wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the prowess of the duelist in a one on one encounter is legendary!
 
Duelists favor light armors and cannot equip a shield. They gain no extra bonus when wielding a weapon with both hands. For their techniques the duelist relies on dexterity.

The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful abilities whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. While they only gain a limited number of blows which can never be magically increased, they are capable of hitting opponents very hard to make the most of each strike. The Mauler is required to use both hands on a single weapon when wielding if they wish their talents to function properly.

<topic:Rune-Knight><color:o>Rune-Knight</color>
The Rune Knight is a mythical warrior-mage who is dedicated to the power of ancient Runes that hold immense power. By affixing these Runes to his equipment, the Rune Knight can become an avatar of destruction, or an invulnerable bastion. Unlike the Warrior-Mage and all other casters, the Rune Knight's mana does not regenerate on its own; rather, the Rune Knight must siphon mana from magical attacks directed at him. The Rune Knight has a fixed (though very large) selection of spells that he can use his mana on, in addition to his unique Rune spells.

<topic:Samurai><color:o>Samurai</color>
Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are the next strongest fighters after Warriors, and can use various special combat techniques. Samurai are not good at most other skills, and many magical devices may be too difficult for them to use. Wisdom determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat techniques available to him.
 
Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to carry them around; the books are needed only when they study new combat techniques. Samurai need a weapon wielded to use the techniques of Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful special properties to their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric, etc... Their maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but solely on wisdom, and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to temporarily increase SP beyond its usual maximum value. They have one more class power - 'Assume a Posture'. They can choose different forms of posture in different situations.

<topic:Warrior><color:o>Warrior</color>
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level devices may be forever beyond their use.
 
Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain experience for destroying high level spellbooks. They have a class power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack in six random directions.

The weaponmaster is great with a single class of weapons. The character gets combat bonuses and special powers depending on the type of specialization. Alas, the weaponmaster is truly lousy when using any weapon outside their chosen specialty so focus is key.

<topic:Weaponsmith><color:o>Weaponsmith</color>
A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even better than Warriors using improved equipments. They cannot cast spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or magic defense.
 
A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these essences to another weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be improved only once, but they can remove a previously added essence from improved equipment to improve it with another essence. To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely up to a maximum value depending on level. Weaponsmiths have a class power - 'Judgment' - which allows them to identify (later *identify*) weapons and armor.

Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the dungeon. An archer is better than a warrior at stealth, perception, searching and magical devices.
 
Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates stones or shots from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.

Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use fearsome archery techniques.
 
What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any situation.
 
Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. They have no time for magic.

A ForceTrainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer fighting with neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. Wisdom is a ForceTrainer's primary stat.
 
ForceTrainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Death, and Crusade. To use The Force, you select it just as if it were spellbook 'w'; which means you need to press 'm' and then 'w' to select the Force. The most important spell of the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a ForceTrainer activates it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and their attack power in bare-handed melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened Force can be released at one stroke when a ForceTrainer activates some other Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

<topic:Monk><color:o>Monk</color>
The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. Their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no armor or weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival a monk may need to wear some kind of armor, but if the armor he wears is too heavy, it will severely disturb his martial arts maneuvers. As the monk advances levels, new, powerful forms of attack become available. Their defensive capabilities increase likewise, but if armour is being worn, this effect decreases. Wisdom determines a Monk's spell casting ability.
 
The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic. They select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Trump and Death. They will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their choice. They have two class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'. They can choose different forms of postures in different situations, and use powerful combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.

Mystics are masters of bare handed fighting, like Monks. However, they do not learn normal spells. Instead, they gain mystical powers with experience, and these powers directly influence their martial arts. In this respect, Mystics are similar to the Samurai. Indeed, they even concentrate to boost their mana like the Samurai. Mystics eschew weapons of any kind and require the lightest of armors in order to practice their martial arts. The number of attacks are influenced by dexterity and experience level while the mystic's mana and fail rates are influenced by charisma. Mystics are in tune with the natural forces around them and may even call on aid when necessary. It has been whispered that mystics have even discovered how to kill an opponent with a single touch, though they do not share this knowledge with novices.

A Blood Mage is similar to a normal mage in his selection and variety of spells, but differs in that he has no separate mana pool. Instead, all his spells are powered by his health. Moreover, due to the Blood Mage's abnormal constitution, all healing is much less effective than normal. In fact, the Blood Mage completely eschews all healing magic as this disrupts the flow of blood that is the essence of their power. They completely shun the realm of Life as anathema to all that is sacred.

<topic:Blue-Mage><color:o>Blue-Mage</color>
A Blue-Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits, as he cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. A major difference between the Mage and the Blue-Mage is the method of learning spells: Blue-Mages may learn spells from monsters. A Blue-Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster ranged attacks, spells, or summons as their own spells; this technique is called Blue magic. Unlike Imitators, Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but they must get hit by a monster's spell while their class power 'Learning' is active to learn spells. Because of this requirement, they do not learn spells, like healing, that affect the monster itself.

High-mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic and learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage. A high mage's prime statistic is intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-mages gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or rods.
 
And then, only High-Mages are able to cast Hex spells.

<topic:Mage><color:o>Mage</color>
A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In addition to his spellbooks, a Mage should carry a range of magical devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master far more easily than anyone else. A Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells. They can freely choose any two realms when a character is created. Their natural inclination makes Life magic fairly hard to learn. Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and cast all the spells in his or her realms better than any other character. The ability to choose second realm of magic has a special meaning: Only the second realm can be changed in the middle of the game. You can change second realm by studying ('G') from a spellbook of new realm. They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.

<topic:Necromancer><color:o>Necromancer</color>
A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through communion with the dead. They use powerful necromancy magic to summon aid from the dead, whether directly in terms of undead servitude, or indirectly through other-worldly knowledge. Necromancy also offers myriad foul offensive spells, but all of these require the Necromancer to physically touch his foe. To do so, the Necromancer may wield neither weapon, nor gloves. But a powerful necromancer is truly awe inspiring, and may even kill foes with a single deadly touch! In addition, they forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand of Vecna in order to complete their power.

<style:heading>Devices</style>
  <indent><topic:Devicemaster><color:o>Devicemaster</color>
Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most other skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will never be their forte. Instead, they must rely on their arsenal of magical devices in order to survive.
 
The Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of devices and they gain extra bonuses when using devices from their speciality. These bonuses include increased damage, increased speed of activation, extra resistance to charge draining, and even the ability to occasionally power these devices without consuming charges. Each of these abilities becomes greater with experience.
 
Devicemasters have a few magical abilities to enhance their utility with devices. As expected, they gain a powerful talent of Recharging very early on. Also, they may detect magical devices from a distance. At higher levels, they gain the powerful ability to move effects from one device to another (wand/rod/staff) or to move essence from one potion/scroll to a lower level potion/scroll. As a final ability, the Devicemaster may use multiple charges at once from a given device in an act of desperation. This greatly increases the power of the effect, but may destroy the device in the process.

<style:heading>Prayer</style>
  <indent><topic:Priest><color:o>Priest</color>
A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They explore the dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly familiar with magical devices which they believe act as foci for divine intervention in the natural order of things. Priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not comfortable with edged weapons. Wielding one will disrupt their ability to concentrate during prayers. A Priest's primary stat is Wisdom.
 
Priests can select from Life, Death, Daemon, or Crusade as a first realm, and choose almost any second realm. However, if they choose a good realm (Life or Crusade) for their first realm, then they are precluded from choosing an evil realm (Death or Daemon) for their second realm, and vice versa. Priests can learn all spells in the selected realms, even if not as efficiently as mages. However, when learning spells, priests cannot voluntarily decide which spells to study: they are rewarded with new prayers by their patron deities, with no money-back satisfaction guarantee. Priests that select a good realm have a class power - 'Bless Weapon' - which allows the priest to wield an edged weapon without penalty. Priests that select an Evil Realm have a class power - 'Evocation' - which damages, scares and banish all monsters in sight.

A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness. He or she can navigate effectively with no light source, catch enemies by surprise, and kill with a single blow. Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are good at locating hidden traps and doors, disarming traps and picking locks. Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will restrict their motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and become faster and more stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja knows no fear and, at high level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to see invisible things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
 
A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.

<topic:Rogue><color:o>Rogue</color>
A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at locating hidden traps and doors and are masters of disarming traps and picking locks. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or to get in a telling first blow. A rogue may also backstab a fleeing monster. Rogues also gain shooting bonuses when using a sling. Intelligence determines a rogue's spell casting ability.
 
Rogues can select one realm from Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, or Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain limitations on which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly. The Burglary Realm however is unique to the rogue and offers spells for setting traps, picking pockets, negotiating with other thieves, and escaping from a tight spot. Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and receive favorable pricing from that shop.

The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and observation skills. The scout is not the best at one-on-one combat, but is unparalleled at ambush techniques to destroy groups of weak sentries. The scout is lightly armored, and heavy armors disrupt their abilities. Furthermore, the scout can only effectively dodge in open areas, being confined severely hampers the scout's defensive abilities.

Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
 
Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon. They are not interested in any other form of magic. They can learn every spell. They have a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which stuns, confuses, and scares all monsters in sight.

A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are very good fighters, but not very good at missile weapons. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical devices but has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. Wisdom determines a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.
 
Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. Like priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with new prayers by their deities. They can learn all spells, but not as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly that they will even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a Death/Daemon Paladin and all spellbooks other than Life or Crusade for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Depending on their realm, they have a class power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.

They can also select a secondary realm (from Sorcery, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon), but they are slow learners here, and may find themselves unable to learn some of the highest level spells. They have a class power - 'Probe Monster' - which allows them to know a monster's HP, speed, and experience required to evolve.

A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between the warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the rangers, specialize in Nature magic and survival skills, true Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the best of both worlds. As warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage class. Intelligence determines a Warrior-Mage's spell casting ability.
 
Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can freely select another realm of magic. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in both realms, thus making them a very competitive choice for players who appreciate Arcane magic. They have two class powers - 'Convert HP to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP' - which allow them to heal HP using mana or gain mana using HP.

Since these powers are developed by the practice of certain disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The available powers are simply determined by the character's level.

<topic:Mirror-Master><color:o>Mirror-Master</color>
Mirror-Masters are spell casters; like other mages, they must live by their wits. They can create magical mirrors, and employ them in the casting of Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a Mirror-Master's spell casting ability.
 
Mirror-Masters gain more spells and each spell becomes more powerful as they gain levels. They can use their spells even when blinded. For Mirror-Masters, the arrangement of mirrors is very important: Some attack spells reflect from mirrors, and some other spells are effective only against monsters standing on a mirror. A Mirror-Master standing on a mirror has greater ability and, for example, can perform quick teleports. The maximum number of magical Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously depends on the level, and breaking unnecessary mirrors is important work for them. They have two class powers - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks all mirrors in current dungeon level and 'Mirror Concentration', which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana on a mirror.

<topic:Psion><color:o>Psion</color>
The Psion is like a Mindcrafter, and uses innate mental powers. Unlike the Mindcrafter, however, Psions have the freedom to learn powers that enforce their own styles. They learn very few powers, but they can scale their powers to determine the SP cost and the powers' potency. Psionic powers require great concentration, however, and psions do not have the mind to spare to care for others. The Psion gains powers a the following levels: 1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40 and 50. The Psion uses Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as their primary spell stat, which ever is currently highest. In this respect, Psions are truly unique!

<topic:Time-Lord><color:o>Time-Lord</color>
Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time to their advantage. They don't learn spells from books, but rather gain new powers as they grow more experienced. They are the only class that can affect monsters with time based attacks. Not only do these damage their foes, but they also inflict a wide variety of possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from evolution to devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to temporal attacks, the Time-Lord gains great powers of speed, and they grow faster with experience. It is said that masters of time can even see the future, avoiding attacks that would otherwise prove fatal! Also, legend has it that the greatest Time-Lords are able to take multiple actions in a single turn.
 
Time-Lords are mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. They are OK with magical devices, but nowhere near as proficient as are mages. They have midling stealth. At high levels, they become resistant to time. The Time-Lord's primary magic stat is Wisdom.

<topic:Warlock><color:o>Warlock</color>
A Warlock, unlike typical mages, derives his powers from pacts with arcane creatures, rather than through careful study. Warlocks possess the unique offensive power of the Eldritch Blast, and they use this without paying any sort of mana or hitpoint costs (though they still have fail rates). The Warlock's primary spell stat is Charisma, and this directly influences the damage of their Eldritch Blast.
 
Each Warlock makes a pact with a single type of creature: Undead, Dragons, Angels, Demons or Aberrations. This pact confers both advantages and disadvantages. For one thing, Warlocks are very ineffective when fighting monsters with whom they have formed an alliance. Every form of damage is actually reduced by a substantial amount, and this makes killing pact monsters extremely difficult. Probably, the Warlock should avoid fighting these monsters altogether. Indeed, at high levels pact monsters are often friendly to the warlock, but some fights cannot be avoided it seems. That's the bad news. The good news is that each pact confers unique abilities and powers to the warlock. These benefits reflect the nature of the pact monster. For example, a pact with Undead confers resistance to Poison and Nether as well as Hold Life, among other things. A pact with Dragons confers the power to resist the elements as well as strong melee (Warlocks are generally poor fighters otherwise). In addition, each pact gives a unique high level offensive power when using their Eldritch Blast.

The Archaeologist is an erudite treasure hunter, seeking out the most valuable prizes that the dungeon has to offer. At home in subterranean caverns and vaults, he is rarely lost or snared in traps. His powers of perception and detection are very great, as is his skill with arcane devices. At high levels he can use the dark magic of the entombed Pharaohs. The powers of the Archaeologist are enhanced by Wisdom.

<topic:Bard><color:o>Bard</color>
Bards are something like traditional musicians. Their magical attacks are sound-based, and last as long as the Bard has mana. Although a bard cannot sing two or more songs at the same time, he or she does have the advantage that many songs affect all areas in sight. A bard's prime statistic is charisma.
 
The songs are found in four songbooks, of which two are sold in town. There is a special feature of music; many songs continue to be sung until either the Bard chooses to stop, or he runs out of the energy required to sing that type of song. Bards have a class power - 'Stop Singing'.

<topic:Imitator><color:o>Imitator</color>
Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on their unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster spells/techniques including their damage and duration. Dexterity determines general imitation ability, but a stat related to the specific action is often also taken into account.
 
To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first. When a viewable monsters uses a spell, it is added to a temporary spell list which the imitator can choose from. Spells should be imitated quickly, because timing and situation are everything. An imitator can only repeat a spell once each time he observes it. They only have a small long-term memory for spells, which ranges from one to three, depending on their level. When they memorize more spells than this, they will forget the oldest spell in the list. They have a class power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows them to imitate spells at double damage or duration.

<topic:Rage-Mage><color:o>Rage-Mage</color>
The Rage Mage is part of a secret sect descending from the Barbarians in response to their natural foes, the mages. As time passed, other races have also begun to learn their arts. The powers of the Rage Mage are spells learned from books, but they don't work the way normal spells do. First of all, the Rage Mage must perform a special Ritual of Anger to learn a spell, and this ritual destroys the spell book in the process. As a result, it may take a long time for the Rage Mage to learn all of their high level powers. Once learned, the Rage Mage no longers requires the spell book in order to perform the power.
 
Another unique aspect of the Rage Mage concerns their Mana pool. Unlike normal spellcasters, the Rage Mage's mana does not regenerate on its own. In fact, their mana actually decreases rapidly each turn, meaning that they had better use their powers quickly while they still can. The Rage Mage gains mana whenever he is the target of a magical spell. Indeed, magic makes the Rage Mage very angry! The Rage Mage can also fuel their mana by hurting those around them. This can be quite effective in crowded situations.

Tourists have visited this world for the purpose of sightseeing. Their fighting skills are bad and they cannot cast powerful spells. They are the most difficult class to win the game with. Intelligence determines a tourist's spell casting ability.
 
Tourists are always seeing more of the world to add to their stock of information; no other class can compete with their identification skills. They have two class powers - 'Take a Photograph' and 'Identify True'. Their magic is based on Arcane, and - aside from identify - is very weak indeed.
